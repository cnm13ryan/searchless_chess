## ClassDef ChessStaticMetrics
**ChessStaticMetrics**: This class encapsulates various metrics retrieved from a supervised chess data loader. It provides a structured way to store and access performance indicators of an agent's predictions against Stockfish evaluations for specific board states (FEN) and legal actions.

**attributes**:
· fen: A string representing the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of a chessboard position, which uniquely defines the state of the game.
· action_accuracy: A boolean indicating whether the agent's predicted best action matches the actual best action as determined by Stockfish.
· output_log_loss: A float value representing the log loss for the agent's predictions. This metric is computed differently based on the model type (action-value, state-value, or behavior cloning).
· kendall_tau: A float value measuring the correlation between the ranking of actions by the agent and Stockfish. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement.
· entropy: A float value representing the average uncertainty in the agent's predicted win probabilities across different return buckets.
· l2_win_prob_loss: An optional float value (None for behavior cloning models) that measures the mean squared difference between the agent's and Stockfish's win probability predictions.
· consistency_loss: An optional float value (None for action-value models) quantifying how consistent the agent's predicted current state win probability is with the maximum next state win probability.

**Code Description**: The ChessStaticMetrics class serves as a container for storing various performance metrics of an agent in a chess game. These metrics are crucial for evaluating and comparing different agents or configurations. The attributes include the board position (fen), accuracy of action predictions, log loss of output probabilities, Kendall tau correlation coefficient, entropy of win probability distributions, L2 loss on win probabilities, and consistency loss between current and next state win probabilities.

The class is utilized by several evaluators within the metrics_evaluator module to compute and aggregate these metrics. For instance, ActionValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator computes action-value specific metrics like l2_win_prob_loss, while StateValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator calculates state-value specific metrics such as consistency_loss. BCChessStaticMetricsEvaluator focuses on behavior cloning models and does not compute l2_win_prob_loss or consistency_loss.

**Note**: The fen attribute is a string that uniquely describes the chessboard position, making it essential for tracking and analyzing performance across different board states. The action_accuracy attribute provides a straightforward measure of prediction accuracy, while output_log_loss offers insight into the confidence and correctness of the agent's predictions. The kendall_tau metric helps in understanding how well the agent ranks actions compared to Stockfish, which is particularly useful for evaluating ranking-based models.

**Output Example**: An instance of ChessStaticMetrics might look like this:
fen: "r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
action_accuracy: True
output_log_loss: 0.6931471805599453
kendall_tau: 0.8571428571428571
entropy: 1.0
l2_win_prob_loss: 0.04
consistency_loss: None

This example illustrates a scenario where the agent's predicted action matches Stockfish's, with a log loss of approximately 0.693 (which corresponds to an even probability distribution), a Kendall tau of about 0.857 indicating good agreement in ranking actions, and an entropy of 1.0 suggesting high uncertainty in win probabilities across different buckets. The l2_win_prob_loss is relatively low at 0.04, while consistency_loss is not applicable for this action-value model instance.
## ClassDef ChessStaticMetricsEvaluator
**ChessStaticMetricsEvaluator**: Evaluator to compute various metrics based on chess game states (FENs) using a specified predictor model.

attributes:
· predictor: The predictive model to be evaluated.
· num_return_buckets: Number of buckets used for categorizing return values.
· dataset_path: Path to the dataset file containing test data.
· batch_size: Number of sequences processed by the predictor in one batch.
· num_eval_data: Optional parameter specifying the number of data points to use for evaluation. If not specified, all available data points are used.

Code Description: The ChessStaticMetricsEvaluator class is an abstract base class designed to evaluate a predictive model on chess game states. It initializes with a given predictor, dataset path, and other parameters necessary for processing and evaluating the data. The evaluator retrieves test data from the specified dataset path and prepares it for evaluation. During the evaluation process, metrics are computed for each game state (FEN) using the provided predictor and then averaged to produce a final set of evaluation results.

The class includes an abstract method _retrieve_test_data which must be implemented by subclasses to provide specific logic for loading and preparing test data. Another abstract method, _compute_metrics, is also required in subclasses to define how metrics are calculated for each game state.

The step method orchestrates the evaluation process. It wraps the predictor with additional functionality provided by neural_engines, computes metrics for all test FENs using the wrapped predictor, and then averages these metrics into a dictionary format suitable for reporting.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of ChessStaticMetricsEvaluator (or one of its subclasses) with appropriate parameters, calling the step method to perform evaluation, and interpreting the returned dictionary of averaged metrics.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value might be:
{'eval_action_accuracy': 0.85, 'eval_output_log_loss': 1.23, 'eval_l2_win_prob_loss': 0.45, 'eval_kendall_tau': 0.90, 'eval_entropy': 2.7}

This output indicates that the evaluator computed several metrics including action accuracy (85%), output log loss (1.23), L2 win probability loss (0.45), Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient (0.90), and entropy of the predicted return distribution (2.7).
### FunctionDef __init__(self, predictor, num_return_buckets, dataset_path, batch_size, num_eval_data)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the ChessStaticMetricsEvaluator class, setting up necessary attributes and preparing test data for evaluation.

parameters:
· predictor: An object representing the predictor model to be evaluated.
· num_return_buckets: The number of return buckets used for categorizing predictions.
· dataset_path: A string indicating the file path to the dataset used for evaluation.
· batch_size: An integer specifying how many sequences are processed by the predictor in one batch.
· num_eval_data: An optional integer that, if provided, limits the number of data points used for evaluation. If not specified, all available data is used.

Code Description: The __init__ method initializes a new instance of the ChessStaticMetricsEvaluator class with the given parameters. It sets up internal attributes such as the predictor model, return bucket edges and values (calculated using utils.get_uniform_buckets_edges_values), dataset path, and batch size. It also retrieves test data by calling the _retrieve_test_data method, which fetches and returns the necessary evaluation data as a dictionary. If num_eval_data is specified, it checks if there are enough data points available; otherwise, it raises a ValueError. If sufficient data points exist, it limits the dataset to the specified number.

Note: This function is crucial for setting up the evaluator with all necessary configurations and data before any performance evaluation can be conducted. It ensures that the predictor model has the correct dataset and parameters to evaluate its performance accurately.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the internal state after initialization could be:
_predictor: <Predictor object>
_return_buckets_edges: [0, 10, 20, 30]
_return_buckets_values: [5, 15, 25]
_dataset_path: 'path/to/dataset.json'
_batch_size: 32
_test_data: {'game1': {'board_state': 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR', 'move': 'e2e4'}, 
             'game2': {'board_state': 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR', 'move': 'd7d5'}}
***
### FunctionDef _metrics_to_filtered_dict(self, metrics)
**_metrics_to_filtered_dict**: This function processes a sequence of ChessStaticMetrics objects to return a dictionary containing averaged values of relevant metrics, excluding the 'fen' attribute and any attributes that have None as their value for at least one metric object.

parameters:
· metrics: A sequence (list or tuple) of ChessStaticMetrics objects. Each object contains various performance metrics related to an agent's predictions in a chess game.

Code Description: The function starts by initializing an empty dictionary, `metrics_dict`, which will store the averaged values of the relevant metrics. It then retrieves all attribute names from the ChessStaticMetrics class using `dataclasses.fields` and stores them in the `fields` list. 

Next, it filters out the 'fen' attribute since it represents a unique board position string and is not suitable for averaging. The function further refines this list by removing any attributes that have None as their value in at least one of the ChessStaticMetrics objects within the input sequence. This ensures that only metrics with complete data are considered.

For each remaining attribute, the function calculates the mean of its values across all provided ChessStaticMetrics objects using a list comprehension and `np.mean`. These averaged values are then stored in `metrics_dict` with their respective attribute names as keys.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where aggregated performance metrics need to be computed for multiple board positions or games. This function is particularly useful when evaluating the overall performance of an agent across various test cases, excluding irrelevant or incomplete data.

Output Example: A possible return value from this function could look like:
{
    'action_accuracy': 0.85,
    'output_log_loss': 0.72,
    'kendall_tau': 0.91,
    'entropy': 0.98,
    'l2_win_prob_loss': 0.03
}
This example illustrates a dictionary where each key represents a metric, and its corresponding value is the average of that metric across multiple ChessStaticMetrics objects. The 'fen' attribute and any attributes with None values are excluded from this output.
***
### FunctionDef step(self, params, step)
**step**: This function evaluates a predictor using given parameters and computes various performance metrics across a set of test data.

parameters:
· params: A dictionary containing the parameters for the neural network model.
· step: An integer representing the current step or iteration number, though it is not used within the function.

Code Description: The `step` function begins by logging an informational message indicating that the metrics evaluator's step process has started. It then wraps the predictor with the provided parameters and batch size using a utility function from `neural_engines`. This wrapped function, `_predict_fn`, will be used to make predictions during the evaluation.

Next, the function logs another informational message about the number of Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) strings in the test data. It computes metrics for each FEN string by calling the `_compute_metrics` method within a list comprehension. This results in a list of `ChessStaticMetrics` objects, where each object contains performance metrics related to an agent's predictions for a specific board position.

After computing all metrics, the function logs that all metrics have been computed and proceeds to write these evaluations into a dictionary format. It does this by calling `_metrics_to_filtered_dict`, which processes the list of `ChessStaticMetrics` objects to return a dictionary containing averaged values of relevant metrics, excluding the 'fen' attribute and any attributes with None as their value for at least one metric object.

Finally, the function constructs a new dictionary where each key is prefixed with 'eval_' to indicate that these are evaluation results. It returns this dictionary, which contains the averaged performance metrics across all test data.

Note: This function is typically used in an iterative process where different sets of parameters or models are evaluated over time. Developers can use it to assess and compare the performance of various configurations by providing different parameter sets and analyzing the returned metrics.

Output Example: A possible return value from this function could look like:
{
    'eval_action_accuracy': 0.85,
    'eval_output_log_loss': 0.72,
    'eval_kendall_tau': 0.91,
    'eval_entropy': 0.98,
    'eval_l2_win_prob_loss': 0.03
}
This example illustrates a dictionary where each key represents an evaluation metric, and its corresponding value is the average of that metric across multiple test cases. The 'fen' attribute and any attributes with None values are excluded from this output.
***
### FunctionDef _retrieve_test_data(self)
**_retrieve_test_data**: Retrieves and returns the test data as a dictionary.
parameters:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The _retrieve_test_data method is designed to fetch and return test data, which is essential for evaluating the performance of a predictor model in the context of chess static metrics. This method is invoked during the initialization phase of the ChessStaticMetricsEvaluator class. It prepares the necessary dataset that will be used later on for evaluation purposes.

The returned dictionary contains key-value pairs where keys are likely identifiers for different data points or features, and values represent the corresponding data or feature values. The exact structure of this dictionary depends on how the test data is organized and retrieved within the method's implementation, which is not detailed in the provided snippet.

Note: This function is crucial as it sets up the dataset that will be used to assess the predictor's performance. It ensures that the evaluator has access to the correct and necessary data before any evaluation steps are taken.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be:
{'game1': {'board_state': 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR', 'move': 'e2e4'}, 
 'game2': {'board_state': 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR', 'move': 'd7d5'}}
***
### FunctionDef _compute_metrics(self, fen)
**_compute_metrics**: This function calculates and returns a set of performance metrics for an agent based on a given Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) string representing a chessboard position.

**parameters**:
· fen: A string that represents the state of a chess game in Forsyth-Edwards Notation. This notation uniquely describes the board configuration, including piece positions and other relevant information such as whose turn it is to move, castling rights, en passant target squares, halfmove clock, and fullmove number.

**Code Description**: The function `_compute_metrics` takes a single argument, `fen`, which is a string representing a chessboard position. It processes this FEN string to evaluate the performance of an agent in terms of various metrics encapsulated within the `ChessStaticMetrics` class. These metrics include action accuracy, output log loss, Kendall tau correlation coefficient, entropy, and potentially L2 win probability loss or consistency loss depending on the model type (action-value, state-value, or behavior cloning). The function returns an instance of `ChessStaticMetrics`, which contains all these computed values.

The function is typically called within a loop that iterates over multiple FEN strings, each representing a different chessboard position. This allows for comprehensive evaluation of the agent across various board states. The results from `_compute_metrics` are then aggregated and used to generate a summary of the agent's performance.

**Note**: Usage points include evaluating an agent's predictions against Stockfish evaluations for specific board states. Developers can use this function to assess different configurations or models by providing various FEN strings and analyzing the returned metrics. Beginners should ensure they understand the meaning of each metric within `ChessStaticMetrics` to interpret the results accurately.
***
## ClassDef ActionValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator
**ActionValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator**: Evaluator specifically designed to compute various metrics based on chess game states (FENs) using a predictive model focused on action values.

attributes:
· predictor: The predictive model to be evaluated.
· num_return_buckets: Number of buckets used for categorizing return values.
· dataset_path: Path to the dataset file containing test data.
· batch_size: Number of sequences processed by the predictor in one batch.
· num_eval_data: Optional parameter specifying the number of data points to use for evaluation. If not specified, all available data points are used.

Code Description: The ActionValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator class extends ChessStaticMetricsEvaluator and is specifically tailored for evaluating predictive models that focus on action values in chess game states (FENs). It initializes with a given predictor model, dataset path, and other parameters necessary for processing and evaluating the data. This evaluator retrieves test data from the specified dataset path, which includes boards represented as FEN strings and mappings of these strings to sequences of legal actions along with their corresponding stockfish scores.

The _retrieve_test_data method processes this raw data by decoding it, sorting the actions, and ensuring that only game states (FENs) with correct legal actions are retained. It logs the fraction of FENs removed due to incorrect legal actions.

The _compute_metrics method uses a neural engine specifically designed for action values to analyze each FEN using the provided predictor model. It then computes various metrics including entropy, L2 loss on centipawn scores, return log loss, action accuracy, and Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient between predicted and actual returns.

The _compute_metrics_from_analysis method is responsible for calculating these specific metrics from the analysis results obtained by the neural engine. It computes the entropy of the predicted return distribution, L2 win probability loss, return log loss, action accuracy, and Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient to evaluate the performance of the predictive model.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of ActionValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator with appropriate parameters such as a predictor model, dataset path, number of return buckets, batch size, and optionally the number of evaluation data points. After initialization, calling the step method performs the evaluation process, computes metrics for all test FENs using the provided predictor, and returns these metrics in a dictionary format suitable for reporting.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value might be:
{'eval_action_accuracy': 0.85, 'eval_output_log_loss': 1.23, 'eval_l2_win_prob_loss': 0.45, 'eval_kendall_tau': 0.90, 'eval_entropy': 2.7}

This output indicates that the evaluator computed several metrics including action accuracy (85%), output log loss (1.23), L2 win probability loss (0.45), Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient (0.90), and entropy of the predicted return distribution (2.7).
### FunctionDef _retrieve_test_data(self)
**_retrieve_test_data**: Retrieves and processes test data from a dataset to return a mapping of chess board positions (FEN strings) to sequences of legal actions and their corresponding stockfish scores.

parameters:
· None: This function does not accept any parameters directly. It relies on the instance variable `_dataset_path` which should be set before calling this method.

Code Description: The function initializes a dictionary `action_score_dict` using `collections.defaultdict(dict)` to store mappings of FEN strings to actions and their associated win probabilities (scores). It reads data from a dataset located at the path specified by the instance variable `_dataset_path` using a `BagReader`. For each piece of data read, it decodes the bytes into a FEN string representing the board position, a move in UCI format, and a win probability score. The move is converted to an action index using the predefined mapping `MOVE_TO_ACTION`, and this action-score pair is stored in `action_score_dict` under the corresponding FEN key.

After collecting all data, the function iterates over each entry in `action_score_dict`. It sorts the actions for each board position by their indices and converts them into a NumPy array of type `np.float32`. The function then checks if the legal actions stored in the dataset match the actual legal moves on the chessboard as determined by the `engine.get_ordered_legal_moves` method. If there is a mismatch, the FEN string is marked for removal from the dictionary.

The fraction of removed entries is logged, and these entries are deleted from `action_score_dict`. Finally, the function returns the cleaned-up dictionary containing only valid board positions with their corresponding legal actions and scores.

Note: This function assumes that certain utilities and constants (`utils.MOVE_TO_ACTION`, `bagz.BagReader`, `constants.CODERS['action_value']`, and `engine.get_ordered_legal_moves`) are properly defined elsewhere in the codebase. The dataset should be structured in a way that is compatible with the decoding process used by this function.

Output Example: A possible return value of `_retrieve_test_data` could look like this:

{
    'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1': array([[2, 0.5], [6, 0.7]], dtype=float32),
    'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/P7/8/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1': array([[4, 0.45], [8, 0.6]], dtype=float32)
}

In this example, each key is a FEN string representing a chess board position, and the corresponding value is a NumPy array where each row contains an action index and its associated win probability score.
***
### FunctionDef _compute_metrics(self, fen)
**_compute_metrics**: This function computes various performance metrics for an action-value agent based on a given Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) string representing a chessboard position.

parameters:
· fen: A string representing the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of a chessboard position, which uniquely defines the state of the game.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if the predictor is initialized. If not, it raises a ValueError indicating that the predictor needs to be set up before calling this method. It then creates an instance of `neural_engines.ActionValueEngine`, passing in `_return_buckets_values` and `_predict_fn`. This engine is used to analyze the chessboard position represented by the FEN string.

The analysis results, which include log probabilities and other relevant data about the board state, are obtained by calling the `analyse` method on the neural engine with a `chess.Board` object created from the provided FEN. These results are then passed to `_compute_metrics_from_analysis`, another function within the same class that calculates specific performance metrics such as entropy, L2 win probability loss, output log loss, action accuracy, and Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient.

Note: This function is typically called internally within a metrics evaluator class to compute specific performance indicators for an agent's predictions against Stockfish evaluations. It requires the predictor to be initialized before use and relies on analysis results from a neural engine that has analyzed a chessboard position.

Output Example: An instance of ChessStaticMetrics might look like this:
fen: "r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
action_accuracy: True
output_log_loss: 0.6931471805599453
l2_win_prob_loss: 0.04
entropy: 1.0
kendall_tau: 0.8571428571428571

This example illustrates a scenario where the agent's predicted action matches Stockfish's, with a log loss of approximately 0.693 (which corresponds to an even probability distribution), a Kendall tau of about 0.857 indicating good agreement in ranking actions, and an entropy of 1.0 suggesting high uncertainty in win probabilities across different buckets. The l2_win_prob_loss is relatively low at 0.04.
***
### FunctionDef _compute_metrics_from_analysis(self, analysis_results)
**_compute_metrics_from_analysis**: This function computes various performance metrics for an action-value agent based on the analysis results of a given chessboard position.

parameters:
· analysis_results: An object containing the analysis results from the neural engine, including log probabilities and Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of the board state.

Code Description: The function begins by extracting the FEN string and legal actions returns from the provided analysis results. It then calculates the return bucket probabilities by exponentiating the log probabilities. Using these probabilities, it computes the entropy, which measures the average uncertainty in the agent's predicted win probabilities across different return buckets.

Next, the function calculates the L2 loss on centipawn scores by comparing the agent's predicted win probabilities with the actual legal actions returns. It also computes the return log loss, which quantifies how well the agent's predicted probabilities align with the true probabilities of the outcomes.

The action accuracy is determined by checking if the agent's predicted best action matches the actual best action as per Stockfish evaluations. If only one legal action is available, the Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient is set to 1, indicating perfect agreement. Otherwise, it calculates the Kendall-Tau between the rankings of actions by the agent and Stockfish.

Finally, the function returns an instance of ChessStaticMetrics containing all computed metrics, including FEN, action accuracy, output log loss, L2 win probability loss, entropy, and Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient.

Note: This function is typically called internally within a metrics evaluator class to compute specific performance indicators for an agent's predictions against Stockfish evaluations. It requires the analysis results from a neural engine that has analyzed a chessboard position.

Output Example: An instance of ChessStaticMetrics might look like this:
fen: "r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
action_accuracy: True
output_log_loss: 0.6931471805599453
l2_win_prob_loss: 0.04
entropy: 1.0
kendall_tau: 0.8571428571428571

This example illustrates a scenario where the agent's predicted action matches Stockfish's, with a log loss of approximately 0.693 (which corresponds to an even probability distribution), a Kendall tau of about 0.857 indicating good agreement in ranking actions, and an entropy of 1.0 suggesting high uncertainty in win probabilities across different buckets. The l2_win_prob_loss is relatively low at 0.04.

## ClassDef StateValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator
**StateValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator**: Evaluator specifically designed to compute various metrics based on chess game states (FENs) using a predictive model focused on state values.

attributes:
· predictor: The predictive model to be evaluated.
· num_return_buckets: Number of buckets used for categorizing return values.
· dataset_path: Path to the dataset file containing test data.
· batch_size: Number of sequences processed by the predictor in one batch.
· num_eval_data: Optional parameter specifying the number of data points to use for evaluation. If not specified, all available data points are used.

Code Description: The StateValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator class extends ActionValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator and is specifically tailored for evaluating predictive models that focus on state values in chess game states (FENs). It initializes with a given predictor model, dataset path, and other parameters necessary for processing and evaluating the data. This evaluator retrieves test data from the specified dataset path, which includes boards represented as FEN strings.

The _compute_metrics method uses a neural engine specifically designed for state values to analyze each FEN using the provided predictor model. It then computes various metrics including consistency loss in addition to those computed by its superclass (ActionValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator). The consistency loss is calculated based on the difference between the current win probability and the maximum next win probability, squared.

The _compute_metrics_from_analysis method inherited from ActionValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator calculates specific metrics such as entropy, L2 loss on centipawn scores, return log loss, action accuracy, and Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient to evaluate the performance of the predictive model. The StateValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator adds consistency loss to these metrics.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of StateValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator with appropriate parameters such as a predictor model, dataset path, number of return buckets, batch size, and optionally the number of evaluation data points. After initialization, calling the step method performs the evaluation process, computes metrics for all test FENs using the provided predictor, and returns these metrics in a dictionary format suitable for reporting.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value might be:
{'eval_action_accuracy': 0.85, 'eval_output_log_loss': 1.23, 'eval_l2_win_prob_loss': 0.45, 'eval_kendall_tau': 0.90, 'eval_entropy': 2.7, 'consistency_loss': 0.01}

This output indicates that the evaluator computed several metrics including action accuracy (85%), output log loss (1.23), L2 win probability loss (0.45), Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient (0.90), entropy of the predicted return distribution (2.7), and consistency loss (0.01).
### FunctionDef _compute_metrics(self, fen)
**_compute_metrics**: This function computes various performance metrics specific to a state-value agent based on the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of a chessboard position.
parameters:
· fen: A string representing the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of a chessboard position, which uniquely defines the state of the game.

Code Description: The function starts by checking if the predictor is initialized. If not, it raises a ValueError indicating that the predictor needs to be set up before calling this method. It then initializes a neural engine with the return bucket values and the prediction function. Using this neural engine, it analyzes the chessboard position represented by the FEN string.

The analysis results are used to compute metrics through a call to the superclass's `_compute_metrics_from_analysis` method, passing in the log probabilities of the next actions and the FEN string. This method computes several metrics such as entropy, L2 win probability loss, output log loss, action accuracy, and Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient.

Additionally, the function calculates the current state's win probability by taking the inner product of the return bucket values with the exponentiated current log probabilities from the analysis results. Similarly, it computes the next states' win probabilities and determines the maximum next state win probability. The consistency loss is then calculated as the squared difference between the current state's win probability and the maximum next state's win probability.

Finally, the function returns an instance of `ChessStaticMetrics` containing all computed metrics, including FEN, action accuracy, output log loss, L2 win probability loss, entropy, Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient, and consistency loss.

Note: This function is typically called internally within a metrics evaluator class to compute specific performance indicators for a state-value agent's predictions against Stockfish evaluations. It requires the analysis results from a neural engine that has analyzed a chessboard position.

Output Example: An instance of ChessStaticMetrics might look like this:
fen: "r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
action_accuracy: True

l2_win_prob_loss: 0.04
entropy: 1.0
kendall_tau: 0.8571428571428571
consistency_loss: 0.01

This example illustrates a scenario where the agent's predicted action matches Stockfish's, with a log loss of approximately 0.693 (which corresponds to an even probability distribution), a Kendall tau of about 0.857 indicating good agreement in ranking actions, and an entropy of 1.0 suggesting high uncertainty in win probabilities across different buckets. The l2_win_prob_loss is relatively low at 0.04, and the consistency loss is 0.01, indicating that the agent's predicted current state win probability is quite consistent with the maximum next state win probability.

## ClassDef BCChessStaticMetricsEvaluator
**BCChessStaticMetricsEvaluator**: Evaluator specifically designed to compute various metrics based on chess game states (FENs) using a predictive model focused on behavioral cloning.

attributes:
· predictor: The predictive model to be evaluated.
· dataset_path: Path to the dataset file containing test data.
· num_return_buckets: Number of buckets used for categorizing return values.
· batch_size: Number of sequences processed by the predictor in one batch.
· num_eval_data: Optional parameter specifying the number of data points to use for evaluation. If not specified, all available data points are used.

Code Description: The BCChessStaticMetricsEvaluator class extends ActionValueChessStaticMetricsEvaluator and is specifically tailored for evaluating predictive models that focus on behavioral cloning in chess game states (FENs). It initializes with a given predictor model, dataset path, and other parameters necessary for processing and evaluating the data. This evaluator retrieves test data from the specified dataset path, which includes boards represented as FEN strings and mappings of these strings to sequences of legal actions along with their corresponding stockfish scores.

The _compute_metrics method uses a neural engine specifically designed for behavioral cloning to analyze each FEN using the provided predictor model. It then computes various metrics including entropy, action log loss, action accuracy, and Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient between predicted and actual returns. The method first checks if the predictor is initialized; if not, it raises a ValueError. It retrieves legal actions and their corresponding stockfish scores for the given FEN from the test data. It identifies the best action based on these scores.

A neural engine (BCEngine) is instantiated with the provided predict function to analyze the chess board state represented by the FEN string. The analysis results include log probabilities of different actions, which are then converted to probabilities. Using these probabilities, the method calculates entropy, action log loss, and action accuracy. Entropy measures the uncertainty in the predicted action distribution. Action log loss quantifies how well the model predicts the best action. Action accuracy indicates whether the model's top prediction matches the actual best action.

The Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient is computed to measure the similarity between the ranking of actions by the model and their actual stockfish scores. If only one legal action exists, perfect agreement (Kendall-Tau = 1) is assumed. The method returns an instance of ChessStaticMetrics containing all calculated metrics along with the FEN string.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of BCChessStaticMetricsEvaluator with appropriate parameters such as a predictor model, dataset path, number of return buckets, batch size, and optionally the number of evaluation data points. After initialization, calling the step method performs the evaluation process, computes metrics for all test FENs using the provided predictor, and returns these metrics in a structured format suitable for reporting.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value might be:
ChessStaticMetrics(
    fen='rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1',
    action_accuracy=0.95,
    output_log_loss=0.34,
    l2_win_prob_loss=None,
    consistency_loss=None,
    kendall_tau=0.98,
    entropy=1.2
)

This output indicates that the evaluator computed several metrics including action accuracy (95%), output log loss (0.34), Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient (0.98), and entropy of the predicted return distribution (1.2) for a given FEN string representing the initial chess board position.
### FunctionDef _compute_metrics(self, fen)
**_compute_metrics**: This function calculates various performance metrics for a chess position using a given FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string. It evaluates the agent's predictions against Stockfish evaluations, computing metrics such as action accuracy, log loss, entropy, and Kendall-Tau correlation.

**parameters**:
· fen: A string representing the Forsyth-Edwards Notation of a chessboard position, which uniquely defines the state of the game.

**Code Description**: The function begins by checking if the predictor has been initialized. If not, it raises a ValueError. It then retrieves legal actions and their corresponding returns from the test data associated with the provided FEN string. The index of the best action (highest return) is determined using `np.argmax`.

A neural engine is instantiated with the prediction function (`_predict_fn`). This engine analyzes the chessboard position represented by the FEN string, producing analysis results that include log probabilities for each legal action. These log probabilities are converted to regular probabilities.

The entropy of the action probabilities is calculated as the average uncertainty across different actions. The action log loss is computed based on the log probability of the best action identified earlier. Action accuracy is determined by comparing the agent's predicted best action with the actual best action according to Stockfish evaluations.

For computing Kendall-Tau, if there is only one legal action available, it defaults to perfect agreement (1.0). Otherwise, it calculates the Kendall-Tau correlation coefficient between the rankings of actions as predicted by the agent and those determined by Stockfish.

Finally, the function returns an instance of `ChessStaticMetrics`, encapsulating all computed metrics for the given FEN string.

**Note**: This function is crucial for evaluating the performance of a chess-playing agent against a strong reference engine (Stockfish). It provides insights into various aspects of the agent's decision-making process, including accuracy, confidence in predictions, and consistency in action ranking.

**Output Example**: An instance of `ChessStaticMetrics` returned by this function might look like:
fen: "r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
action_accuracy: True
output_log_loss: 0.6931471805599453
kendall_tau: 0.8571428571428571
entropy: 1.0
l2_win_prob_loss: None
consistency_loss: None

This example illustrates a scenario where the agent's predicted action matches Stockfish's, with a log loss of approximately 0.693 (indicating an even probability distribution), a Kendall tau of about 0.857 indicating good agreement in ranking actions, and an entropy of 1.0 suggesting high uncertainty in win probabilities across different buckets. The `l2_win_prob_loss` and `consistency_loss` are not applicable for this behavior cloning model instance and thus are set to None.
