## FunctionDef train(train_config, predictor_config, build_data_loader)
**train**: Trains a predictor using specified configurations and returns the trained parameters.

**parameters**:
· train_config: An instance of `config_lib.TrainConfig` containing training-specific settings such as learning rate, gradient clipping norm, checkpoint frequency, etc.
· predictor_config: An instance of `transformer.TransformerConfig` that holds configuration details for building the transformer model, including seed values and other hyperparameters.
· build_data_loader: A function from `constants.DataLoaderBuilder` used to create a data loader based on the provided training configuration.

**Code Description**: The `train` function orchestrates the process of training a transformer-based predictor. It begins by logging information about the current JAX process, including its index, count, and local device count. Using the provided configurations, it constructs a transformer predictor and initializes a data loader with a seed adjusted for multi-host environments to ensure different processes train on distinct subsets of data.

The function then initializes the parameters of the predictor using a random number generator seeded from `predictor_config`. It also creates an exponential moving average (EMA) copy of these parameters. An optimizer, defined as a chain of gradient clipping and Adam optimization steps, is set up and initialized with the initial parameters.

Next, loss and update functions are created to compute the loss and apply updates to the model's parameters based on gradients. The function sets up sharding for parallel device usage across all available devices, replicates the parameters and optimizer state across these devices, and prepares a checkpoint manager if checkpointing is enabled.

The main training loop iterates over a range of steps from `latest_step` (which can be restored from a previous checkpoint) to `train_config.num_steps`. During each step, it optionally saves checkpoints at specified intervals. It retrieves sequences and loss masks from the data loader, applies sharding constraints, and updates the model parameters using the update function.

Throughout training, the function logs the current step number, loss value, and unclipped gradient norm at specified logging intervals. After completing all steps, it closes the checkpoint manager if used and returns the trained model parameters.

**Note**: This function is designed to work in a distributed JAX environment, making use of multiple processes and devices for efficient training. It also supports resuming training from checkpoints, which can be useful for long-running experiments or when training needs to be paused and restarted.

**Output Example**: The output is the trained model parameters as a dictionary-like structure (`hk.Params`), which could look something like this:
```
{
  'transformer': {
    'layer_0': {
      'self_attention': {'wq': array([...]), 'wk': array([...]), ...},
      'ffn': {'dense_1': {'kernel': array([...])}, 'dense_2': {'kernel': array([...])}},
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
}
```
Each key in the dictionary corresponds to a layer or sublayer of the transformer, and each value is another dictionary containing parameter arrays for that layer.
