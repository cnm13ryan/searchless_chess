## ClassDef StockfishEngine
**StockfishEngine**: The classical version of Stockfish chess engine integrated into a Python class. This class provides methods to analyze board positions and determine the best move based on the Stockfish engine's evaluation.

attributes:
· limit: An instance of `chess.engine.Limit` that defines time controls for the analysis or play operations.
· skill_level: An integer representing the skill level of the Stockfish engine, which can be set by the user. If not set, it remains as None.

Code Description: The `StockfishEngine` class inherits from a base `engine.Engine` class and is designed to interact with the Stockfish chess engine through the `chess.engine.SimpleEngine` interface. Upon initialization, it sets up the engine's binary path relative to the current working directory and launches the engine in UCI mode. The destructor ensures that the engine process is properly closed when an instance of `StockfishEngine` is deleted.

The class provides properties for accessing and setting the analysis time limit (`limit`) and the skill level (`skill_level`). Setting the skill level configures the underlying Stockfish engine to operate at a specified difficulty, affecting its playing strength.

Two primary methods are provided:
- `analyse`: This method takes a `chess.Board` object as input and returns an analysis result from the Stockfish engine. The analysis is performed within the constraints defined by the `limit`.
- `play`: This method also accepts a `chess.Board` object and uses the Stockfish engine to determine and return the best move for the current position, adhering to the specified time limit.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of `StockfishEngine`, setting the desired skill level if necessary, and using the `analyse` or `play` methods to evaluate board positions or find optimal moves. It is important to ensure that the Stockfish binary path is correctly set relative to the script's execution environment.

Output Example: When calling the `play` method on a given chess board position, the output would be a `chess.Move` object representing the best move according to the Stockfish engine. For instance, if the best move is e5e6 (moving a pawn from e5 to e6), the returned `chess.Move` object would encapsulate this information. Similarly, calling `analyse` on the same board might return an analysis result detailing various aspects of the position evaluation such as score, depth, and principal variation line.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, limit)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the StockfishEngine class, setting up necessary parameters and launching the Stockfish chess engine.

parameters:
· limit: An object of type chess.engine.Limit that specifies time controls for the engine's moves.
· skill_level: Although not explicitly included in the parameter list, this attribute is initialized to None. It likely represents the difficulty level at which the engine plays.

Code Description: The __init__ method performs several key actions:
1. It assigns the provided limit object to an instance variable _limit, which will be used to control how much time the engine spends on each move.
2. The _skill_level attribute is initialized to None. This suggests that skill level might be set later through another method or property of the class.
3. A binary path for the Stockfish executable is constructed by joining the current working directory with a relative path pointing to the stockfish file located in the ../Stockfish/src/ directory.
4. The chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci method is called with the constructed binary path, launching the Stockfish engine in UCI (Universal Chess Interface) mode and storing the resulting engine object in the _raw_engine instance variable.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that the Stockfish executable is correctly located at the specified path relative to the script's working directory. Developers should also be aware that while skill_level can be set later, it starts as None, which might affect how the engine behaves if not properly configured before use.

### FunctionDef __del__(self)
**__del__**: This function serves as a destructor in Python, automatically called when an object's reference count reaches zero, indicating that there are no more references to the object. In this context, it ensures that resources associated with the Stockfish engine are properly released.

parameters:
· None: The __del__ method does not accept any parameters. It is implicitly called by Python's garbage collector and operates on the instance of the class (self) for which it is defined.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The function **__del__** is a special method in Python that acts as a destructor, responsible for cleaning up resources when an object is about to be destroyed. In this specific implementation, the function calls `self._raw_engine.close()`. This line of code suggests that `_raw_engine` is likely an attribute of the class instance and represents some form of engine or connection (possibly related to the Stockfish chess engine). The method `close()` on `_raw_engine` is presumably designed to properly shut down, disconnect, or release any resources held by this engine. This could include closing network connections, freeing up memory, or terminating processes that were started when the engine was initialized.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should be aware that relying on __del__ for resource management can sometimes lead to issues, such as circular references preventing objects from being garbage collected, or resources not being released promptly if there are lingering references. It is generally recommended to use context managers (the `with` statement) and explicit cleanup methods when possible, rather than depending solely on __del__. However, in scenarios where automatic resource management is necessary and the object's lifecycle can be controlled, implementing a destructor like this one can be useful for ensuring that resources are properly released.
***
### FunctionDef limit(self)
**limit**: This function returns a chess.engine.Limit object associated with the StockfishEngine instance.
parameters:
· None: The limit function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The limit function is a method defined within the StockfishEngine class. It serves to retrieve an existing chess.engine.Limit object that has been set or initialized elsewhere in the StockfishEngine class. This Limit object typically encapsulates time controls and other constraints for the engine's operations, such as move time limits or depth limits during game play.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where a developer might need to access or modify the time controls or other operational limits of the Stockfish chess engine within their application. By calling this function, they can obtain the current Limit object and then adjust its properties according to their requirements before passing it back to the engine for use in game play.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The returned chess.engine.Limit object might look like this when printed or logged:
Limit(time=10.0, depth=None, nodes=None, mate=None, white_clock=None, black_clock=None, white_inc=None, black_inc=None)
This example indicates that the time limit for each move is set to 10 seconds, with no other specific limits defined (depth, nodes, mate, or clock settings).
***
### FunctionDef skill_level(self)
**skill_level**: This function retrieves the current skill level setting of the Stockfish chess engine.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The `skill_level` function is a method defined within the `StockfishEngine` class. It returns an integer representing the current skill level of the Stockfish chess engine, or `None` if no skill level has been set. This value is stored in the private attribute `_skill_level`. The function does not perform any calculations or operations; it simply accesses and returns this stored value.

Note: Usage points include checking the current difficulty setting of the Stockfish engine to ensure it matches the desired level for a particular game session. Developers can use this method to verify settings or integrate it into user interfaces where users can adjust the engine's strength.

Output Example: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be `15`, indicating that the Stockfish engine is set to skill level 15, which corresponds to a strong but not unbeatable difficulty. Alternatively, if no skill level has been explicitly set, the function might return `None`.
***
### FunctionDef skill_level(self, skill_level)
**skill_level**: This function sets the skill level of the Stockfish chess engine.
parameters:
· skill_level: An integer representing the desired skill level of the Stockfish engine. The value should be within a predefined range, typically from 0 (weakest) to 20 (strongest).

Code Description: The `skill_level` method is designed to adjust the difficulty or strength of the Stockfish chess engine by setting its internal skill level parameter. When this function is called with an integer argument representing the desired skill level, it updates the `_skill_level` attribute of the class instance to reflect this new value. Subsequently, it configures the underlying raw engine (presumably a wrapper around the actual Stockfish executable) with this new skill level by passing a dictionary containing the key 'Skill Level' and the corresponding integer value.

Note: Usage points include setting the engine's difficulty before starting a game or during gameplay to adapt the challenge according to the player's preference. It is important to ensure that the provided `skill_level` is within the acceptable range supported by the Stockfish engine to avoid any unexpected behavior or errors.
***
### FunctionDef analyse(self, board)
**analyse**: This function provides analysis results from Stockfish, a strong chess engine, based on the current state of a given chess board.
parameters:
· board: An instance of the chess.Board class representing the current position of the chess game to be analyzed.

Code Description: The analyse method takes a chess board as input and returns an analysis result. It uses the internal Stockfish engine (referenced by self._raw_engine) to perform the analysis. The analysis is limited according to the criteria defined in self._limit, which could include time limits or depth of search among other parameters.

Note: This function is useful for developers who are integrating chess functionalities into their applications and need detailed insights from a powerful engine like Stockfish. Beginners can use this method to understand how a professional chess engine evaluates different board positions.

Output Example: The return value, an instance of engine.AnalysisResult, might look something like this:
{
    'score': {'cp': 15},
    'pv': ['e2e4', 'd7d5'],
    'depth': 18,
    'seldepth': 20,
    'multipv': 1,
    'nodes': 3964,
    'nps': 198200,
    'tbhits': 0,
    'time': 20
}
In this example, the score shows that White is slightly better by 15 centipawns. The principal variation (pv) suggests e2e4 as the first move followed by d7d5. Other fields provide additional information about the analysis process such as depth of search, nodes evaluated, and time taken.
***
### FunctionDef play(self, board)
**play**: This function determines and returns the best move for a given chess position using Stockfish, an advanced chess engine.

parameters:
· board: An instance of `chess.Board` representing the current state of the chess game. It includes all pieces' positions and other relevant information such as whose turn it is to play, castling rights, en passant target square, etc.

Code Description: The function `play` takes a chess board configuration as input and utilizes an internal Stockfish engine instance (`self._raw_engine`) to compute the optimal move. It calls the `play` method of this engine with the current board state and a time limit defined by `self._limit`. The result from the engine includes various information, but only the `move` attribute is extracted as the best possible move according to Stockfish's evaluation. If for some reason no move can be determined (which should not happen under normal circumstances), a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message.

Note: Usage points include integrating this function into chess-playing applications where automated moves are required, or in scenarios where developers need to leverage the strength of Stockfish to analyze and predict game outcomes. It's essential that the input board is correctly set up according to the rules of chess for accurate results.

Output Example: A possible return value from this function could be `chess.Move.from_uci('e2e4')`, representing a move from square e2 to e4, which is one of the most common opening moves in chess.
***
## ClassDef AllMovesStockfishEngine
**AllMovesStockfishEngine**: A specialized version of the Stockfish chess engine designed to evaluate each legal move individually on a given board position, providing detailed analysis for each move.

attributes:
· limit: An instance of `chess.engine.Limit` that defines time controls for the analysis or play operations. This attribute is inherited from the parent class `StockfishEngine`.

Code Description: The `AllMovesStockfishEngine` class extends the functionality of the `StockfishEngine` by offering a more granular approach to move evaluation. Instead of determining a single best move, this class evaluates all legal moves available on the board and returns their respective scores. This can be particularly useful for applications that require comprehensive analysis of possible game states.

The primary methods provided by this class are:
- `analyse`: This method takes a `chess.Board` object as input and returns a dictionary containing a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a move and its corresponding score relative to the current player. The moves are evaluated individually using the Stockfish engine within the constraints defined by the `limit`. The method first retrieves all legal moves from the board, sorts them in an order determined by the `engine.get_ordered_legal_moves` function, and then evaluates each move separately.
- `play`: This method also accepts a `chess.Board` object. It leverages the `analyse` method to obtain scores for all possible moves and selects the move with the highest score as the best move. The selected move is returned as a `chess.Move` object.

Note: Usage points include initializing an instance of `AllMovesStockfishEngine`, setting the desired analysis time limit, and using the `analyse` or `play` methods to evaluate board positions or find optimal moves. It is important to ensure that the Stockfish binary path is correctly set relative to the script's execution environment.

Output Example: When calling the `play` method on a given chess board position, the output would be a `chess.Move` object representing the best move according to the Stockfish engine after evaluating all possible moves. For instance, if the best move is e5e6 (moving a pawn from e5 to e6), the returned `chess.Move` object would encapsulate this information. Similarly, calling `analyse` on the same board might return an analysis result in the form of {'scores': [(Move(e5e6), Score(Cp(20))), (Move(d4d5), Score(Cp(15))), ...]}, detailing the score for each legal move.
### FunctionDef analyse(self, board)
**analyse**: Returns analysis results from Stockfish by evaluating each legal move on a given chess board.
parameters:
· board: An instance of the chess.Board class representing the current state of the chess game.

Code Description: The function begins by initializing an empty list named scores to store the evaluation results for each move. It then retrieves all legal moves from the provided chess board, ordering them using a method defined in the engine module. For each move in this ordered list, the function calls the _raw_engine.analyse method with the current board state, a predefined limit (likely controlling the depth of analysis), and the specific move to be analyzed as the root move. The result from this analysis includes various metrics, but only the relative score is extracted and stored alongside the move in the scores list. Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the scores list.

Note: This function is crucial for obtaining detailed evaluation results for all possible moves on the board, which can be used to make informed decisions or further analysis. It leverages Stockfish's powerful engine capabilities to provide deep insights into each potential move.

Output Example: {'scores': [((Move.from_uci('e2e4'), 0.15), (Move.from_uci('d2d4'), -0.05), ...]} where each tuple contains a Move object and its corresponding relative score from Stockfish's analysis.
***
### FunctionDef play(self, board)
**play**: Returns the best move from Stockfish based on an analysis of the current chess board state.
parameters:
· board: An instance of the chess.Board class representing the current state of the chess game.

Code Description: The function play is designed to determine and return the optimal move for a given position in a chess game by leveraging the capabilities of the Stockfish engine. It starts by invoking the analyse method, which evaluates all legal moves available on the provided board. The results from this analysis are stored in a list called scores, where each element is a tuple consisting of a Move object and its corresponding relative score as determined by Stockfish.

The function then sorts these tuples in descending order based on the relative scores to prioritize higher-scoring moves. By accessing the first element of this sorted list (which corresponds to the move with the highest score), play returns the best move according to Stockfish's evaluation.

Note: This function is essential for applications that require automated decision-making in chess, such as AI opponents or analysis tools. It relies on the comprehensive analysis provided by the analyse method to make informed decisions about which move to execute next.

Output Example: Move.from_uci('e2e4') where 'e2e4' represents the UCI notation of the best move determined by Stockfish's analysis for the given board state.
