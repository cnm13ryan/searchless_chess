## ClassDef NeuralEngine
**NeuralEngine**: Base class for neural engines designed to interact with chess boards using predictive models.

attributes:
· return_buckets_values: An optional numpy array representing values associated with different return buckets used in the model's predictions.
· predict_fn: The function responsible for generating raw outputs from the neural model. This function is expected to take sequences of tokenized board states and actions as input and output log probabilities or similar metrics.
· temperature: A float value that influences the randomness of move selection by adjusting the softmax temperature used in probability calculations.

Code Description: The NeuralEngine class serves as a foundational component for various chess-playing engines that leverage neural networks. It initializes with optional parameters including return_buckets_values, predict_fn, and temperature. These attributes are crucial for defining how the engine interacts with the model and makes decisions during gameplay. The _rng attribute is initialized to generate random numbers, which can be used in stochastic decision-making processes such as move selection based on predicted probabilities.

The class does not define specific methods for playing or analyzing a board state directly; instead, it provides a structure that subclasses can extend to implement these functionalities. Subclasses like ActionValueEngine, StateValueEngine, and BCEngine inherit from NeuralEngine and override the analyse and play methods to provide specialized behavior tailored to different types of neural models.

Note: When using this class or its subclasses, developers should ensure that the predict_fn is properly defined and compatible with the input data format expected by the model. The temperature parameter can be adjusted to control the exploration-exploitation trade-off in move selection, where lower temperatures lead to more deterministic choices based on higher predicted probabilities.

Output Example: While NeuralEngine itself does not produce an output, its subclasses do. For instance, a call to the play method of ActionValueEngine might return a chess.Move object representing the chosen move for a given board state. Similarly, the analyse method could return a dictionary containing log probabilities and the FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) representation of the board. Here is an example output from the play method:

chess.Move.from_uci('e2e4')

This indicates that the engine has chosen to move the pawn from e2 to e4, which is a common opening move in chess.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, return_buckets_values, predict_fn, temperature)
**__init__**: Initializes a new instance of the NeuralEngine class, setting up essential attributes for handling predictions and randomness.

parameters:
· return_buckets_values: An optional numpy array that specifies bucket values to be returned by the engine.
· predict_fn: An optional function used for making predictions; it should conform to the PredictFn type signature.
· temperature: An optional float value representing a parameter that might influence the randomness or variability in predictions, often used in models like GPT.

Code Description: The constructor method __init__ is responsible for initializing the NeuralEngine object with provided parameters. It assigns the given return_buckets_values, predict_fn, and temperature to their respective instance variables. If these parameters are not provided (i.e., they are None), the corresponding attributes remain as None. Additionally, it initializes a random number generator using numpy's default_rng method, which is stored in the _rng attribute. This random number generator can be used later for operations that require randomness, such as sampling from probability distributions.

Note: The NeuralEngine class expects certain types and behaviors from its parameters. For instance, predict_fn should be callable and conform to a specific signature expected by the engine's other methods. The temperature parameter is particularly relevant in scenarios where probabilistic outputs are generated, affecting the diversity of predictions.

Output Example: Upon initialization with default values (all None), an instance of NeuralEngine would have its attributes set as follows:
- _return_buckets_values: None
- predict_fn: None
- temperature: None
- _rng: A numpy random number generator object initialized with a default seed.

## FunctionDef _update_scores_with_repetitions(board, scores)
**_update_scores_with_repetitions**: This function updates the win-probabilities for a given chess board state by considering possible repetitions that could lead to draws.

parameters:
· board: An instance of `chess.Board` representing the current state of the chess game.
· scores: A NumPy array containing the win probabilities associated with each legal move from the current board position.

Code Description: The function starts by obtaining a list of sorted legal moves for the given board using the `engine.get_ordered_legal_moves(board)` method. It then iterates over these moves, temporarily applying each one to the board with `board.push(move)`. For each move, it checks if the resulting board state would lead to a draw due to fivefold repetition or threefold repetition claims using `board.is_fivefold_repetition()` and `board.can_claim_threefold_repetition()`, respectively. If either condition is met, indicating that the move could result in a draw, the corresponding entry in the `scores` array is set to 0.5, reflecting a 50% win probability for that move. After evaluating each move, the board state is reverted to its original position using `board.pop()` to ensure that subsequent moves are evaluated from the same starting point.

Note: This function is called by methods in both `ActionValueEngine` and `StateValueEngine` classes within the `play` method. It adjusts the win probabilities of potential moves based on the possibility of draws due to repetitions, which is crucial for making informed decisions in chess games where draw conditions can significantly impact strategy.
## ClassDef ActionValueEngine
**ActionValueEngine**: Neural engine specialized for evaluating actions on a chess board using a probabilistic model P(r | s, a), where r represents return buckets, s is the state of the board, and a is an action (move).

attributes:
· return_buckets_values: An optional numpy array representing values associated with different return buckets used in the model's predictions.
· predict_fn: The function responsible for generating raw outputs from the neural model. This function takes sequences of tokenized board states and actions as input and outputs log probabilities or similar metrics.
· temperature: A float value that influences the randomness of move selection by adjusting the softmax temperature used in probability calculations.

Code Description: ActionValueEngine extends NeuralEngine to provide specific functionalities for analyzing a chess board state and selecting moves based on predicted outcomes. The class includes two primary methods: analyse and play.

The analyse method processes the current state of a chess board, tokenizes legal actions, and prepares sequences that combine the board's state with these actions. It then uses the predict_fn to compute log probabilities for each action and returns these along with the FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) representation of the board.

The play method leverages the results from analyse to determine the best move. It calculates win probabilities by combining return bucket probabilities with predefined values. The method also adjusts scores based on repeated positions to avoid loops. Depending on whether a temperature is set, it either selects a move randomly according to these probabilities (with higher temperatures leading to more randomness) or chooses the move with the highest probability.

Note: Developers should ensure that predict_fn is properly defined and compatible with the input data format expected by the model. The temperature parameter can be adjusted to control the exploration-exploitation trade-off in move selection, where lower temperatures lead to more deterministic choices based on higher predicted probabilities.

Output Example: A call to the play method might return a chess.Move object representing the chosen move for a given board state. For instance:

chess.Move.from_uci('e2e4')

This indicates that the engine has chosen to move the pawn from e2 to e4, which is a common opening move in chess. Similarly, a call to analyse could return:

{'log_probs': array([-0.1, -0.3, -0.5]), 'fen': 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1'}

This output shows log probabilities for three legal moves and the FEN representation of the initial board state.
### FunctionDef analyse(self, board)
**analyse**: This function processes a given chess board state to return log-probabilities for each legal action (move) available from that position, along with the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) representation of the board.

parameters:
· board: An instance of `chess.Board` representing the current state of the chess game.

Code Description: The function begins by retrieving a list of all legal moves for the current player on the provided board. These moves are then converted into an array of action tokens using a predefined mapping (`utils.MOVE_TO_ACTION`). This array is reshaped to ensure compatibility with subsequent operations.

Next, the function prepares dummy return buckets, which are essentially placeholders used in the sequence construction process. The FEN string of the current board state is tokenized and converted into an integer array. This tokenized FEN is then replicated for each legal move to form a base sequence that will be extended by appending the action tokens and the dummy return buckets.

The sequences, now consisting of the tokenized FEN, action tokens, and dummy return buckets, are passed through a prediction function (`self.predict_fn`). The output from this function corresponds to log-probabilities for each legal move. These probabilities reflect the model's assessment of the likelihood of each move being optimal or advantageous in the current game state.

Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing these log-probabilities and the FEN string of the board.

Note: This function is crucial for evaluating possible moves in a chess game from a given position, providing insights that can be used to make informed decisions about subsequent actions. It serves as a foundational step in more complex decision-making processes, such as those implemented in the `play` method.

Output Example: 
{'log_probs': array([-2.34567890e-01, -1.23456789e+00, -1.11111111e+00, ..., -5.55555556e-01]), 'fen': 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1'}
***
### FunctionDef play(self, board)
**play**: This function determines the optimal move for a given chess board state by analyzing possible moves and their associated probabilities of leading to a win, while also considering potential draws due to repetitions.

parameters:
· board: An instance of `chess.Board` representing the current state of the chess game.

Code Description: The function starts by calling the `analyse` method on the provided board. This method returns log-probabilities for each legal move available from the current position, along with the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) representation of the board. These log-probabilities are then converted to regular probabilities using the exponential function.

Next, the function calculates win probabilities by taking the inner product of the probability array and a predefined set of return bucket values (`self._return_buckets_values`). This step adjusts the probabilities based on the expected returns from each move.

The `_update_scores_with_repetitions` function is then invoked to adjust these win probabilities. It considers possible repetitions that could lead to draws, setting the win probability for such moves to 0.5 (indicating a 50% chance of winning).

After updating the scores, the function retrieves a list of sorted legal moves from the board using `engine.get_ordered_legal_moves(board)`. If a temperature parameter is set, it uses this value to apply softmax scaling to the win probabilities, introducing randomness into the decision-making process. The move is then selected randomly based on these scaled probabilities.

If no temperature is specified, the function selects the move with the highest win probability directly.

Note: This function is crucial for making informed decisions in a chess game by evaluating all possible moves and their outcomes, while also accounting for potential draws due to repetitions. It balances between optimal play and randomness, depending on whether a temperature parameter is provided.

Output Example: Assuming the board state has three legal moves with win probabilities of 0.4, 0.35, and 0.25 respectively, and no temperature is set, the function would return the move corresponding to the highest probability (0.4). If a temperature of 1.0 were used, it might return any of the three moves based on their probabilities, with a higher likelihood for the first move due to its higher probability.
***
## ClassDef StateValueEngine
**StateValueEngine**: Neural engine specialized for predicting state values using a function P(r | s), where r represents the return (or value) given a board state s.

attributes:
· predict_fn: The function responsible for generating raw outputs from the neural model, expected to take sequences of tokenized board states and actions as input and output log probabilities.
· temperature: A float value that influences the randomness of move selection by adjusting the softmax temperature used in probability calculations. Lower temperatures lead to more deterministic choices based on higher predicted probabilities.

Code Description: The StateValueEngine class extends NeuralEngine, focusing on predicting state values for chess board positions. It includes methods for analyzing a board state and playing a move based on these predictions.

The _get_value_log_probs method tokenizes the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) strings of board states, prepares them by adding dummy return buckets, and then uses the predict_fn to obtain log probabilities for the final token in each sequence. This method is crucial for obtaining value estimates for given board positions.

The analyse method computes the current state's log probability and explores one move ahead to estimate the next states' values. It generates a list of FEN strings representing all possible legal moves from the current position, retrieves their log probabilities using _get_value_log_probs, and flips these probabilities to compute negative values. The method returns a dictionary containing the current log probabilities, next state log probabilities, and the current board's FEN.

The play method uses the analyse method to get the next states' log probabilities, converts them into regular probabilities, and calculates win probabilities by taking the inner product of these probabilities with return_buckets_values. It adjusts these probabilities based on repeated positions using _update_scores_with_repetitions. The method then selects a move either randomly (based on softmax probabilities adjusted by temperature) or deterministically (choosing the move with the highest win probability).

Note: Developers should ensure that predict_fn is properly defined and compatible with the input data format expected by the model. Adjusting the temperature parameter can help control the exploration-exploitation trade-off in move selection.

Output Example: A call to the play method might return a chess.Move object representing the chosen move for a given board state. For example, if the engine decides to move a pawn from e2 to e4, the output would be:

chess.Move.from_uci('e2e4')
### FunctionDef _get_value_log_probs(self, predict_fn, fens)
**_get_value_log_probs**: This function computes the value log probabilities for a given set of Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) strings representing chess board positions using a prediction function.

parameters:
· predict_fn: A callable that takes sequences of tokenized FENs and returns predictions. It is expected to be a neural network model or similar predictive function.
· fens: A sequence of strings, each string being a FEN representation of a chessboard position.

Code Description: The function begins by tokenizing the input FEN strings using a tokenizer (not explicitly defined in this snippet but assumed to be available). These tokenized representations are then converted into a NumPy array with an integer data type. A dummy return bucket, initialized as zeros, is created for each FEN string and concatenated to the end of the tokenized sequences along the second axis. This setup prepares the input format required by the prediction function. Finally, the function calls `predict_fn` on these sequences and extracts the last column of the output array, which contains the value log probabilities.

Note: The function is designed to work with a specific structure where each FEN string is tokenized and processed in conjunction with an additional return bucket, likely used for internal computations or as part of the model's input requirements. This function is typically called within a broader context, such as evaluating board positions in a chess engine.

Output Example: If `predict_fn` returns a 2D array where each row corresponds to a FEN string and columns represent different predictions (including value log probabilities), `_get_value_log_probs` will return the last column of this array. For instance, if `predict_fn` outputs `[[0.1, 0.9], [0.3, 0.7]]`, then `_get_value_log_probs` would return `[0.9, 0.7]`.
***
### FunctionDef analyse(self, board)
**analyse**: Defines a policy that predicts action and action value by evaluating the current board state and potential next states in a chess game.

parameters:
· board: An instance of `chess.Board` representing the current state of the chessboard.

Code Description: The function begins by obtaining the log probabilities of the current board position using `_get_value_log_probs`, which processes the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) string representation of the board. It then generates a list of FEN strings for all possible next board positions resulting from legal moves available on the current board. For each move, it temporarily applies the move to the board, records the new state as a FEN string, and reverts the board to its original state. These FEN strings are used again with `_get_value_log_probs` to predict log probabilities for these potential next states. The log probabilities for the return buckets are flipped (using `np.flip`) to compute negative values, which is likely part of the algorithm's strategy for evaluating moves. Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the current board's log probabilities, the log probabilities of all possible next board positions, and the FEN string of the current board.

Note: This function plays a crucial role in decision-making processes within a chess engine by providing insights into the value of different board states and potential moves. It is typically used to inform more complex strategies or policies that determine which move to make next in a game.

Output Example: 
{
    'current_log_probs': array([0.2, 0.3, 0.5]),
    'next_log_probs': array([
        [0.1, 0.4, 0.5],
        [0.6, 0.2, 0.2],
        [0.3, 0.3, 0.4]
    ]),
    'fen': 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1'
}
***
### FunctionDef play(self, board)
**play**: This function determines the next move to be played on a chess board by evaluating the current state of the game using neural network predictions and adjusting for potential draws due to repetitions.

parameters:
· board: An instance of `chess.Board` representing the current state of the chess game.

Code Description: The function starts by calling the `analyse` method with the provided `board` object. This method returns a dictionary containing log probabilities of the next possible moves (`next_log_probs`). These log probabilities are then converted to regular probabilities using the exponential function, resulting in `next_probs`. To estimate the win probability for each move, an inner product is computed between `next_probs` and `_return_buckets_values`, yielding `win_probs`.

The function then calls `_update_scores_with_repetitions` with the board and `win_probs` as arguments. This step adjusts the win probabilities by setting them to 0.5 for moves that could lead to a draw due to fivefold or threefold repetition rules.

Next, the function retrieves a list of sorted legal moves from the current board state using `engine.get_ordered_legal_moves(board)`. If the temperature parameter is set (not None), it applies softmax to the win probabilities divided by the temperature value. This introduces randomness into the decision-making process, making it less deterministic and more exploratory. The function then selects a move randomly based on these adjusted probabilities.

If the temperature parameter is not set, the function simply chooses the move with the highest win probability from `win_probs`.

Note: This function is crucial for determining the next move in a chess game by leveraging neural network predictions to evaluate potential moves and adjusting for strategic considerations such as draw conditions. It balances exploration and exploitation through the use of a temperature parameter.

Output Example: Assuming the board state leads to three possible legal moves with win probabilities of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 respectively, and no adjustments are made due to repetitions or temperature settings, the function would return the move corresponding to the highest probability (0.6). If a temperature is applied, it might return any of the three moves based on their adjusted probabilities.
***
## ClassDef BCEngine
**BCEngine**: Defines a policy that predicts action probabilities for chess moves using a neural network model.

attributes:
· return_buckets_values: An optional numpy array representing values associated with different return buckets used in the model's predictions.
· predict_fn: The function responsible for generating raw outputs from the neural model. This function is expected to take sequences of tokenized board states and actions as input and output log probabilities or similar metrics.
· temperature: A float value that influences the randomness of move selection by adjusting the softmax temperature used in probability calculations.

Code Description: BCEngine extends the NeuralEngine class, providing specific implementations for analyzing a chess board state and playing moves based on predicted action probabilities. The `analyse` method tokenizes the current board state into an integer sequence using a tokenizer, then appends a dummy action to form a complete input sequence for the neural model. It uses the `predict_fn` attribute to obtain log probabilities of all possible actions from the model. These probabilities are renormalized to only include legal moves on the board by mapping them through a softmax function and returning both the log probabilities and the FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) representation of the board.

The `play` method leverages the output from `analyse` to select a move. If the temperature attribute is set, it adjusts the probability distribution of moves using a softmax with the given temperature before randomly selecting a move based on these probabilities. This allows for controlled exploration-exploitation trade-offs in decision-making. If no temperature is specified, the method selects the move with the highest predicted log probability.

Note: Developers should ensure that the `predict_fn` attribute is properly defined and compatible with the input data format expected by the neural model. The `temperature` parameter can be adjusted to control the randomness of move selection, where lower temperatures lead to more deterministic choices based on higher predicted probabilities.

Output Example: A call to the `play` method might return a chess.Move object representing the chosen move for a given board state. For instance:

chess.Move.from_uci('e2e4')

This indicates that the engine has chosen to move the pawn from e2 to e4, which is a common opening move in chess. Similarly, a call to the `analyse` method could return a dictionary containing log probabilities and the FEN representation of the board:

{'log_probs': array([-1.5, -0.8, ...]), 'fen': 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1'}
### FunctionDef analyse(self, board)
**analyse**: This function defines a policy to predict action probabilities based on the current state of a chess board. It tokenizes the board's FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string, prepares it for prediction, and calculates log probabilities for legal moves.

**parameters**:
· board: An instance of `chess.Board` representing the current state of the chess game.

**Code Description**: The function starts by converting the board's FEN string into a tokenized format suitable for input to a neural network model. This involves using a tokenizer to transform the FEN string into an integer array, which is then reshaped to add a batch dimension. A dummy action is appended to this sequence to match the expected input shape of the prediction function.

The `predict_fn` method is called with the prepared sequences to obtain log probabilities for all possible actions (moves). These probabilities are initially calculated for all potential moves, not just legal ones. To ensure that only legal moves are considered, the function retrieves a list of sorted legal moves from the board and maps these moves to their corresponding action indices.

The log probabilities associated with the legal actions are then extracted and renormalized using the `jnn.log_softmax` function. This step ensures that the probabilities sum to one over all legal moves, making them suitable for use in decision-making processes such as move selection.

**Note**: The function returns a dictionary containing the log probabilities of legal moves and the FEN string of the board at the time of analysis. This information can be used by other components of the system, such as the `play` method, to make decisions about which move to execute next.

**Output Example**: 
{'log_probs': array([-2.345, -1.678, -0.987], dtype=float32), 'fen': 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1'}
***
### FunctionDef play(self, board)
**play**: This function selects a move to play on a given chess board based on an analysis of the current board state. It uses the log probabilities of legal moves obtained from the `analyse` method, optionally applying a temperature parameter to influence the randomness of the selection.

**parameters**:
· board: An instance of `chess.Board` representing the current state of the chess game.

**Code Description**: The function begins by calling the `analyse` method with the provided chess board as an argument. This method returns a dictionary containing log probabilities for each legal move on the board. These log probabilities are extracted from the returned dictionary and stored in the variable `action_log_probs`.

Next, the function retrieves a list of sorted legal moves from the board using the `get_ordered_legal_moves` function. If a temperature parameter is provided (i.e., it is not `None`), the function applies this temperature to the log probabilities by dividing them by the temperature value and then converting these adjusted probabilities into a probability distribution using the softmax function.

The `_rng.choice` method is then used to randomly select one of the legal moves based on the newly computed probability distribution. This introduces an element of randomness in move selection, with the degree of randomness controlled by the temperature parameter. If no temperature is provided, the function selects the move with the highest log probability directly using `np.argmax`.

**Note**: The temperature parameter can be used to control the exploration-exploitation trade-off in move selection. A higher temperature value increases the randomness of the move selection, encouraging more exploration of different moves. Conversely, a lower temperature value makes the selection process more deterministic, favoring exploitation of the best-known moves.

**Output Example**: Assuming the board state results in three legal moves with log probabilities [-2.345, -1.678, -0.987], and a temperature of 1.0 is applied, the function might return one of these moves based on their adjusted probability distribution. If no temperature is provided, it would return the move corresponding to the highest log probability, which in this case would be the third move.
***
## FunctionDef wrap_predict_fn(predictor, params, batch_size)
**wrap_predict_fn**: Returns a simple prediction function from a predictor and parameters. This function wraps around a given neural network predictor to handle batching of input sequences efficiently.

parameters:
· predictor: An instance of constants.Predictor, used to predict outputs based on the provided inputs.
· params: Neural network parameters that are passed to the predictor during inference.
· batch_size: An integer indicating how many sequences should be processed at once by the predictor. The default value is 32.

Code Description: The function begins by jitting the `predict` method of the given `predictor`. Jitting, provided by JAX, compiles the predict function for faster execution on subsequent calls. A nested function named `fixed_predict_fn` is defined to ensure that only sequences with a length equal to `batch_size` are passed to the jitted prediction function. This function asserts that the input sequence's first dimension matches the batch size and then invokes the jitted predictor.

Another nested function, `predict_fn`, handles the batching of input sequences. It calculates how many sequences need to be padded to reach a multiple of the batch size, pads the sequences accordingly, splits them into batches, and processes each batch using `fixed_predict_fn`. After collecting all outputs from the processed batches, it concatenates these outputs and trims any padding that was added during batching.

Note: The function assumes that the input sequences are numpy arrays. It is crucial to ensure that the predictor's predict method accepts parameters named `params`, `targets`, and `rng` as shown in the code. Additionally, the predictor should be compatible with JAX for jitting to work effectively.

Output Example: If the input sequences are a numpy array of shape (100, 5) and the batch size is set to 32, the function will pad these sequences to a shape of (112, 5), split them into four batches of 32 sequences each, process each batch, concatenate the results, and finally return an output array of shape (100, X), where X is determined by the predictor's output dimensions.
### FunctionDef fixed_predict_fn(sequences)
**fixed_predict_fn**: This function acts as a wrapper around the predictor `predict` function, specifically designed to handle sequences of data that have been preprocessed to match a fixed batch size.

**parameters**:
· sequences: A NumPy array representing the input sequences for prediction. The shape of this array must be such that its first dimension equals the predefined `batch_size`.

**Code Description**: The `fixed_predict_fn` function begins by asserting that the number of sequences (the length of the first dimension of the `sequences` array) matches the `batch_size`. This ensures that the input is correctly batched before being passed to the prediction model. It then calls the `jitted_predict_fn`, a presumably optimized or compiled version of the prediction function, with the parameters `params` and `targets` set to `params` and `sequences` respectively, and `rng` set to `None`. The result is returned directly.

**Note**: This function assumes that the input sequences have already been preprocessed to fit into batches of a specific size (`batch_size`). It does not handle any padding or splitting of sequences; it expects the input to be correctly shaped. If the input sequences do not match the expected batch size, an assertion error will be raised.

**Output Example**: Assuming `params` is properly configured and `sequences` is a NumPy array with shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, the output would be a NumPy array of predictions with the same number of rows as `sequences`. For instance, if `sequences` has a shape of (32, 100), where 32 is the batch size and 100 is the length of each sequence, the output will also have a shape of (32, prediction_length), where `prediction_length` depends on what the model outputs.
***
### FunctionDef predict_fn(sequences)
**predict_fn**: Wrapper to collate batches of sequences of fixed size for prediction.
parameters:
· sequences: A NumPy array representing the input sequences for prediction. The shape of this array is expected to be (number_of_sequences, sequence_length).

Code Description: The function `predict_fn` is designed to handle sequences that may not naturally fit into predefined batch sizes required by the prediction model. It first calculates how many additional sequences are needed to fill the last batch (`remainder`). These sequences are then padded with zeros using NumPy's `np.pad` method, ensuring that the total number of sequences becomes a multiple of the batch size.

The padded array is subsequently split into smaller arrays, each containing exactly `batch_size` sequences. This splitting is achieved using `np.split`. Each sub-array (representing a full batch) is then passed to `fixed_predict_fn`, which handles the prediction for that specific batch. The outputs from all batches are collected in a list (`all_outputs`) and concatenated into a single NumPy array.

An assertion checks that the length of the concatenated output matches the length of the padded sequences, ensuring no data was lost or misaligned during processing. Finally, the function returns only the predictions corresponding to the original input sequences by cropping the padded outputs back to the original size.

Note: This function is particularly useful when dealing with datasets where the number of samples does not perfectly align with the batch size required for efficient computation. It ensures that all data points are included in the prediction process without altering their content, aside from necessary padding for batching.

Output Example: Assuming `sequences` has a shape of (35, 100) and `batch_size` is set to 32, the function will pad the input to make it (64, 100). It then splits this into two batches of size 32 each. After prediction, the output will be concatenated back into a single array of shape (64, prediction_length), where `prediction_length` is determined by the model's architecture. The final returned output will have a shape of (35, prediction_length), corresponding to the original number of input sequences.
