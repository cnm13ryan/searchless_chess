## FunctionDef get_ordered_legal_moves(board)
**get_ordered_legal_moves**: This function retrieves a list of legal moves from a given chess board state, ordered by their corresponding action values.

parameters:
· board: An instance of `chess.Board` representing the current state of the chess game.

Code Description: The function takes a chess board as input and uses the `legal_moves` attribute to get all possible legal moves for the current player. These moves are then sorted based on their action values, which are determined by mapping each move's UCI (Universal Chess Interface) string representation to an action value using a dictionary stored in `utils.MOVE_TO_ACTION`. The sorting is performed using Python's built-in `sorted()` function with a custom key that fetches the action value for each move.

Note: This function assumes that the `utils` module contains a dictionary named `MOVE_TO_ACTION`, which maps UCI strings of chess moves to their respective action values. Developers should ensure this dictionary is correctly populated and imported in the `engine.py` file for the function to work as intended.

Output Example: If the board state allows for the moves e2-e4, d1-f3, and c5-c6, and these moves have corresponding action values of 0.8, 0.9, and 0.7 respectively in `utils.MOVE_TO_ACTION`, then the function would return a list of move objects representing the moves in the following order: [d1-f3, e2-e4, c5-c6].
## ClassDef Engine
**Engine**: The Engine class serves as a protocol defining two essential methods: `analyse` and `play`. This class is intended to be implemented by any object that can perform chess analysis and generate moves based on a given chess board state.

attributes:
· analyse: A method that takes a chess.Board object as input and returns an AnalysisResult. It encapsulates the logic for analyzing the current state of the chess game.
· play: A method that also takes a chess.Board object as input but returns a chess.Move, representing the best legal move according to the engine's evaluation.

Code Description: The Engine class is defined as a Protocol, which means it acts as an interface in Python. It does not provide any concrete implementation for its methods; instead, it specifies the expected method signatures that any implementing class must adhere to. This design pattern is particularly useful for ensuring consistency across different implementations of chess engines.

The `analyse` method is designed to perform a comprehensive analysis of the given chess board state. The input parameter, `board`, is an instance of the `chess.Board` class from the python-chess library, which represents the current position on the chessboard. The return type, `AnalysisResult`, suggests that this method should provide detailed insights into the game's status, such as potential threats, opportunities, and evaluations of different moves.

The `play` method is focused on determining the best legal move for the player whose turn it is in the given board state. Similar to `analyse`, it accepts a `chess.Board` object as input but returns a single `chess.Move`. This method encapsulates the decision-making process that leads to selecting the optimal move, taking into account various factors like material balance, piece activity, and strategic considerations.

Note: When implementing the Engine protocol, developers must ensure that both methods handle all possible board states correctly, including edge cases such as checkmate, stalemate, or insufficient material. Additionally, it is crucial for the `play` method to only return legal moves, as illegal moves can lead to invalid game states and disrupt gameplay.
### FunctionDef analyse(self, board)
**analyse**: This function processes a given chess board state and returns an analysis result based on model evaluation.

parameters:
· board: An instance of the chess.Board class representing the current state of the chess game to be analyzed.

Code Description: The analyse method takes a single parameter, 'board', which is expected to be an object of the chess.Board class. This class typically encapsulates all information about the current state of a chess game, including piece positions, player turns, and move history. The function then uses this board state as input for some form of analysis model (not detailed in the provided code snippet), likely performing tasks such as evaluating the strength of each side's position, suggesting optimal moves, or predicting the outcome of the game based on the current configuration.

The output of the analyse method is an 'AnalysisResult', which is presumably a custom data structure or class that encapsulates various pieces of information about the analysis performed. This could include scores for material advantage, positional evaluations, suggested moves, and other relevant metrics derived from the model's assessment of the board state.

Note: Usage points. Developers should ensure that the chess.Board object passed to this function accurately reflects the current game state they wish to analyze. Beginners might find it helpful to familiarize themselves with how the chess.Board class is used within their specific chess library or framework, as this will be crucial for preparing the correct input for the analyse method. Additionally, understanding what information is contained within the returned AnalysisResult can help in effectively utilizing the output of this function for further game analysis or decision-making processes.

### FunctionDef play(self, board)
**play**: Returns the best legal move from a given board.
parameters:
· board: An instance of chess.Board representing the current state of the chess game.

Code Description: The function play is designed to analyze a provided chess board state and determine the optimal next move for the player whose turn it is. It takes one parameter, 'board', which must be an object of type chess.Board from the python-chess library. This object encapsulates all necessary information about the current game state, including piece positions, the side to move, castling rights, en passant target squares, and halfmove and fullmove clocks.

The function processes this board state to evaluate possible moves and selects the one deemed best according to its internal logic or algorithm. The returned value is a chess.Move object representing the chosen move. This move is guaranteed to be legal within the context of the provided board state, as the function's implementation ensures that only valid moves are considered.

Note: Usage points. Developers should ensure they pass a correctly initialized and updated chess.Board instance to this function. Beginners might find it helpful to familiarize themselves with the python-chess library documentation to understand how to create and manipulate chess boards. The play function is expected to be part of an AI engine or similar system that automates decision-making in a chess game, making it a crucial component for applications like automated chess players or analysis tools.
