## FunctionDef _process_fen(fen)
**_process_fen**: This function processes a Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) string representing a chessboard position into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
parameters:
· fen: A string that represents a chessboard position using FEN notation.

Code Description: The function takes a single argument, `fen`, which is expected to be a string in the Forsyth-Edwards Notation format. This format is commonly used to describe a particular board position of a chess game. The function then uses a tokenizer (presumably defined elsewhere in the codebase) to convert this FEN string into a sequence of tokens. These tokens are numerical representations that can be more easily processed by machine learning algorithms. The resulting array of tokens is converted to a 32-bit integer type using `astype(np.int32)` before being returned.

Note: This function is utilized in several data processing pipelines within the project, specifically in the methods `map` of classes `ConvertBehavioralCloningDataToSequence`, `ConvertStateValueDataToSequence`, and `ConvertActionValueDataToSequence`. These methods decode input bytes into FEN strings (and possibly other data), process the FEN string using `_process_fen`, and then concatenate this processed state with additional data to form sequences for training or evaluation.

Output Example: Given a typical FEN string such as "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1", the output of `_process_fen` would be an array of integers, for example: `array([26, 34, 27, 35, 28, 36, 29, 37, 30, 38, 31, 39, 32, 40, 33, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63], dtype=int32)`. The exact integers will depend on the tokenizer's mapping of FEN characters to numerical values.
## FunctionDef _process_move(move)
**_process_move**: This function converts a move string into a numpy array representation based on a predefined mapping.
parameters:
· move: A string representing a chess move, which is then converted to its corresponding action integer using a utility dictionary.

Code Description: The function _process_move takes a single argument, 'move', which is expected to be a string denoting a chess move (e.g., "e2e4"). It uses this string as a key to look up the corresponding integer value in the MOVE_TO_ACTION dictionary from the utils module. This integer represents the action associated with the given move in the context of the game's state representation. The function then converts this integer into a numpy array with a data type of int32 and returns it.

Note: This function is utilized within two other functions, map, found in ConvertBehavioralCloningDataToSequence and ConvertActionValueDataToSequence classes respectively. In both cases, the returned numpy array is concatenated with other arrays representing different aspects of the game state to form a complete sequence for training purposes.

Output Example: If the input move string is "e2e4" and according to utils.MOVE_TO_ACTION, this corresponds to the integer 50, then the function will return np.array([50], dtype=np.int32).
## FunctionDef _process_win_prob(win_prob, return_buckets_edges)
**_process_win_prob**: This function processes a win probability by converting it into a return bucket using specified bin edges.

parameters:
· win_prob: A float representing the probability of winning, typically ranging from 0 to 1.
· return_buckets_edges: An array of bin edges used to categorize the win probability into predefined buckets.

Code Description: The function takes a win probability and an array defining the edges of return buckets. It converts the single win probability value into a numpy array and then uses this array along with the provided bin edges to compute which bucket the win probability falls into. This is achieved by calling another utility function, `compute_return_buckets_from_returns`, which categorizes the win probability based on the defined bins.

Note: The function is utilized in two different mapping functions within the same module (`ConvertStateValueDataToSequence/map` and `ConvertActionValueDataToSequence/map`). These mappings are part of a data processing pipeline that transforms raw encoded data into sequences suitable for training machine learning models. Specifically, it helps in categorizing the win probability into predefined buckets which can then be used as part of the input features for these models.

Output Example: If `win_prob` is 0.75 and `return_buckets_edges` are [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1], the function would return an array indicating that the win probability falls into the third bucket (corresponding to values between 0.5 and 0.75). The exact output format depends on how `compute_return_buckets_from_returns` is implemented but typically it could be a one-hot encoded vector or an index representing the bucket number. For instance, if the function returns a one-hot encoded vector, the output might look like [0, 0, 1, 0].
## ClassDef ConvertToSequence
**ConvertToSequence**: Base class for converting chess data to a sequence of integers.
attributes:
· num_return_buckets: An integer specifying the number of return buckets used for categorizing win probabilities.

Code Description: The ConvertToSequence class serves as an abstract base class designed to facilitate the conversion of various types of chess-related data into sequences of integers. This transformation is crucial for preparing data for machine learning models, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning or supervised learning tasks involving chess games. Upon initialization, it calculates uniform bucket edges based on the specified number of return buckets using a utility function `get_uniform_buckets_edges_values`. These bucket edges are used to categorize win probabilities into discrete intervals.

The class also initializes a loss mask, which is an array of boolean values indicating which parts of the sequence should be considered during training. The loss mask ensures that only the final element (related to the return bucket) influences the loss calculation, effectively focusing the model's learning on predicting the outcome rather than intermediate states.

A key feature of ConvertToSequence is its abstract property `_sequence_length`, which must be implemented by any subclass. This property defines the total length of the sequence produced by the conversion process, accommodating different types and amounts of data (e.g., state, action, win probability).

Note: Usage points include extending this class to create specific converters tailored for different datasets or learning objectives in chess-related machine learning tasks.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given `num_return_buckets=5`, an instance of ConvertToSequence would have `_return_buckets_edges` calculated accordingly. The loss mask would be initialized as a boolean array with all elements set to True except for the last one, which is False.

Subclasses like ConvertBehavioralCloningDataToSequence, ConvertStateValueDataToSequence, and ConvertActionValueDataToSequence implement the specific logic for converting different types of chess data into integer sequences. For instance, ConvertBehavioralCloningDataToSequence would convert a given FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string and move into a sequence that includes both the state representation and the action taken, followed by the loss mask.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, num_return_buckets)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the ConvertToSequence class by setting up return bucket edges and a loss mask based on the specified number of return buckets.

parameters:
· num_return_buckets: An integer specifying the number of return buckets to be used for sequence conversion.

Code Description: The __init__ method is responsible for initializing key attributes within the ConvertToSequence class. It starts by calling the superclass's initializer, ensuring that any setup required by parent classes is performed. Following this, it calculates the edges of uniform buckets using a utility function `get_uniform_buckets_edges_values`, which takes the number of return buckets as an argument. These bucket edges are stored in the `_return_buckets_edges` attribute.

The method then proceeds to create a boolean array named `_loss_mask`. The shape of this array is determined by the value returned from the `_sequence_length` method, which is expected to provide the length of the sequence. Initially, all elements in the `_loss_mask` are set to True, indicating that all positions in the sequence are considered for loss calculation during training. However, the last element of the mask is explicitly set to False, suggesting that the final position in the sequence will be excluded from loss calculations.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should ensure that the `_sequence_length` method is properly implemented before instantiating objects of the ConvertToSequence class or using any functionality dependent on this attribute. The correct implementation of `_sequence_length` is crucial as it directly affects the shape and behavior of the `_loss_mask`, which in turn influences how loss calculations are applied during training.

Output Example: If `num_return_buckets` is set to 5, and assuming `_sequence_length()` returns 10, the initialization would result in:
- `_return_buckets_edges` being an array defining the edges for 5 uniform buckets.
- `_loss_mask` being a boolean array of length 10 with all values True except the last one, which is False: `[True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, False]`.
***
### FunctionDef _sequence_length(self)
**_sequence_length**: This function is intended to return an integer representing the length of a sequence. However, it currently raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that its implementation is pending.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The _sequence_length method is defined within a class (presumably ConvertToSequence based on the context provided). Its purpose is to provide the length of a sequence which could be used in various computations or data manipulations. In the current state, this function does not perform any operations and simply raises a NotImplementedError. This suggests that while the method is expected to return an integer value representing the sequence length, its actual implementation has yet to be defined.

The method is referenced within the __init__ constructor of the ConvertToSequence class where it is used to initialize the _loss_mask attribute. The _loss_mask is a boolean array with a shape determined by the output of _sequence_length. All values in this array are initially set to True, except for the last element which is set to False. This mask could be utilized during training processes to selectively apply loss calculations only to certain parts of the sequence.

Note: Usage points.
Developers should note that attempting to instantiate an object of ConvertToSequence or use any functionality dependent on _sequence_length will result in a NotImplementedError until this method is properly implemented. It is crucial for developers to define what constitutes the "sequence length" in the context of their application and provide an appropriate implementation for this function.
***
## ClassDef ConvertBehavioralCloningDataToSequence
**ConvertBehavioralCloningDataToSequence**: Converts chess game data, specifically FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) strings and moves, into a sequence of integers suitable for machine learning models. This class extends ConvertToSequence to tailor the conversion process for behavioral cloning tasks.

attributes:
· element: A bytes object containing encoded chess game data, including both the FEN string and the move made in that position.

Code Description: The ConvertBehavioralCloningDataToSequence class is a specialized converter designed for transforming chess game data into integer sequences. This transformation is essential for training machine learning models to predict actions based on board states (behavioral cloning). The class inherits from ConvertToSequence, which provides the foundational structure and functionalities necessary for converting various types of chess-related data.

The primary method in this class is `map`, which takes a bytes object as input. This object contains encoded chess game data, specifically a FEN string representing the board state and a move made from that position. The method decodes this data using a predefined coder (`CODERS['behavioral_cloning']`) to extract the FEN string and the move.

The extracted FEN string is then processed by `_process_fen`, which converts it into an integer representation of the board state. Similarly, the move is processed by `_process_move` to convert it into an integer format representing the action taken. These two sequences (state and action) are concatenated to form a single sequence.

The total length of this sequence is defined by the `_sequence_length` property, which returns `tokenizer.SEQUENCE_LENGTH + 1`. This additional element accounts for both the state representation and the action taken in that state.

Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the generated sequence and a loss mask. The loss mask is inherited from ConvertToSequence and ensures that only the final element of the sequence (related to the return bucket) influences the loss calculation during training. This focus on the return bucket aligns with the objective of behavioral cloning, which aims to replicate expert behavior by learning the correct actions for given board states.

Note: Usage points include integrating this class into data pipelines for machine learning models that require integer-encoded sequences as input. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the goal is to train a model to predict optimal moves based on chess positions, facilitating applications such as automated chess engines or educational tools.

Output Example: Given an encoded element representing a FEN string and a move, the `map` method might produce the following output:
- Sequence: [13, 24, 0, 56, 78, 90, 1] (where the first five integers represent the board state, the sixth integer represents the action taken, and the last integer is a placeholder for future use)
- Loss Mask: [True, True, True, True, True, True, False] (indicating that all elements except the last one should be considered during training)
### FunctionDef _sequence_length(self)
**_sequence_length**: This function calculates and returns the sequence length required for converting behavioral cloning data into a sequence format suitable for processing by machine learning models.
parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The function `_sequence_length` is designed to determine the total sequence length needed when preparing data for behavioral cloning tasks. It retrieves the base sequence length from a `tokenizer` object, which presumably holds configuration or constants related to data tokenization and processing. To this base sequence length, it adds 1 to account for an additional element, possibly representing an action (a) following a state (s). This adjustment ensures that each sequence includes both a state and its corresponding action, facilitating the learning of mappings from states to actions in behavioral cloning.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where data preprocessing is necessary before feeding it into models for behavioral cloning. The returned value should be used to configure or validate the dimensions of input sequences in the model training pipeline.

Output Example: If `tokenizer.SEQUENCE_LENGTH` is 10, the function will return 11, indicating that each sequence should consist of 10 states followed by 1 action.
***
### FunctionDef map(self, element)
**map**: This function processes a byte-encoded element containing chessboard position (FEN) and move data into a sequence suitable for training machine learning models, along with a loss mask.

parameters:
· element: A bytes object that contains encoded information about a chessboard position and a move in the format expected by the 'behavioral_cloning' coder.

Code Description: The function `map` takes an input byte-encoded element. This element is decoded using a predefined coder from the constants module, specifically designed for behavioral cloning data. The decoding process extracts two pieces of information: a Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) string representing the chessboard position and a move string indicating a player's action.

The FEN string is then processed by the `_process_fen` function, which converts it into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models. This involves tokenizing the FEN string into an array of integers that represent different elements on the chessboard.

Simultaneously, the move string is converted into its corresponding action integer using the `_process_move` function. This function maps the move to an integer based on a predefined dictionary and then converts this integer into a numpy array with a data type of int32.

The processed state (FEN) and action (move) arrays are concatenated to form a single sequence that represents both the board position and the player's action. This sequence is returned alongside a loss mask, which is an attribute of the class instance (`self._loss_mask`). The loss mask is used during training to indicate which parts of the output should be considered in computing the loss function.

Note: This function is part of the `ConvertBehavioralCloningDataToSequence` class and is utilized in data processing pipelines where behavioral cloning data needs to be transformed into a format suitable for machine learning models. The returned sequence combines both state and action information, which can then be used as input features for training or evaluating models.

Output Example: Given an element that decodes to the FEN string "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1" and the move string "e2e4", the function will first process the FEN string into an array of integers representing the board state. Suppose this results in `array([26, 34, 27, 35, 28, 36, 29, 37, 30, 38, 31, 39, 32, 40, 33, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63], dtype=int32)`. The move string "e2e4" is then converted to its corresponding action integer, say `50`, resulting in the array `array([50], dtype=int32)`. These two arrays are concatenated to form the sequence `array([26, 34, 27, 35, 28, 36, 29, 37, 30, 38, 31, 39, 32, 40, 33, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 50], dtype=int32)`. The function returns this sequence along with the loss mask, which might look something like `array([1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1], dtype=bool)` depending on its definition.
***
## ClassDef ConvertStateValueDataToSequence
**ConvertStateValueDataToSequence**: Converts chess data, specifically FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) strings and win probabilities, into a sequence of integers suitable for machine learning models.

attributes:
· num_return_buckets: An integer specifying the number of return buckets used for categorizing win probabilities. This attribute is inherited from the base class ConvertToSequence.

Code Description: The ConvertStateValueDataToSequence class extends the functionality provided by its parent class, ConvertToSequence, to handle a specific type of chess data conversion. It focuses on transforming FEN strings and win probabilities into integer sequences that can be used for training machine learning models.

The class defines an abstract property _sequence_length from the base class, which specifies the total length of the sequence produced by the conversion process. In this implementation, the sequence length is set to tokenizer.SEQUENCE_LENGTH + 1, accounting for both the state representation derived from the FEN string and the win probability bucket index.

The map method takes a single element (a byte-encoded string) as input, decodes it into a FEN string and a win probability using constants.CODERS['state_value'].decode(element). It then processes the FEN string to generate a state representation and categorizes the win probability into one of the predefined return buckets. These two components are concatenated to form the final sequence.

The method returns a tuple containing the generated sequence and a loss mask, which is inherited from the base class. The loss mask indicates that only the last element (the win probability bucket index) should be considered during training, focusing the model's learning on predicting the outcome of the game rather than intermediate states.

Note: This class is particularly useful in scenarios where the goal is to predict the final outcome of a chess game based on its current state. It can be used as part of a larger data pipeline for training reinforcement learning or supervised learning models that aim to evaluate the likelihood of winning from a given board position.

Output Example: Given num_return_buckets=5, an instance of ConvertStateValueDataToSequence would have _return_buckets_edges calculated accordingly. Suppose the FEN string is 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1' and the win probability is 0.65. The method would process the FEN to generate a state representation (e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) and categorize the win probability into one of the five buckets (e.g., bucket index 3). The resulting sequence might be [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3], with a loss mask of [True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, False].
### FunctionDef _sequence_length(self)
**_sequence_length**: This function calculates and returns the sequence length used in processing state-value data by adding one to a predefined SEQUENCE_LENGTH value from the tokenizer module.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The function _sequence_length is designed to determine the total sequence length required for converting state-value data into a sequence format. It retrieves the base sequence length defined in the tokenizer module and increments it by one. This increment likely accounts for an additional element, possibly representing a start or end token in the sequence, as indicated by the comment "(s) +  (r)" which could stand for "start" plus "rest" of the sequence elements.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where the exact length of sequences is crucial for data processing tasks such as training machine learning models. The returned value from this function should be used consistently across the data loading and preprocessing steps to ensure uniformity in input dimensions.

Output Example: If tokenizer.SEQUENCE_LENGTH is set to 10, calling _sequence_length would return 11, indicating that each sequence will consist of 11 elements.
***
### FunctionDef map(self, element)
**map**: This function processes an input byte element containing encoded state-value data into a sequence suitable for training machine learning models. It decodes the byte data to extract Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) string representing a chessboard position and a win probability, then converts these into numerical formats that can be used as model inputs.

**parameters**:
· element: A bytes object containing encoded state-value data which includes both a FEN string and a win probability.

**Code Description**: The function begins by decoding the input byte using a predefined coder specified in `constants.CODERS['state_value']`. This decoder extracts two pieces of information from the byte data: a FEN string (`fen`) representing the chessboard position, and a float value (`win_prob`) indicating the probability of winning. 

The FEN string is then processed by `_process_fen`, which converts it into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models. This involves tokenizing the FEN string using a tokenizer (likely defined elsewhere in the codebase) to generate an array of tokens, each representing a specific element on the chessboard. These tokens are converted to 32-bit integers.

Simultaneously, the win probability is processed by `_process_win_prob`, which categorizes it into predefined buckets based on specified bin edges (`self._return_buckets_edges`). This function converts the win probability into a numpy array and uses these bin edges to determine which bucket the probability falls into. The result is typically a one-hot encoded vector or an index representing the bucket number.

The processed state (numerical representation of the FEN string) and the return bucket (categorized win probability) are concatenated to form a single sequence. This sequence, along with a loss mask (`self._loss_mask`), is returned as output. The loss mask is likely used during training to indicate which parts of the data should be considered when calculating loss.

**Note**: This function is part of the `ConvertStateValueDataToSequence` class and is utilized in data processing pipelines that transform raw encoded data into sequences suitable for training machine learning models, particularly those related to chess state-value predictions.

**Output Example**: Given an input byte element representing a FEN string "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1" and a win probability of 0.75, the function might return:
```
(array([26, 34, 27, 35, 28, 36, 29, 37, 30, 38, 31, 39, 32, 40, 33, 41, 42, 43,
        44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61,
        62, 63,  0,  0,  1,  0], dtype=int32), array([1]))
```
Here, the first part of the output is a concatenated array consisting of the numerical representation of the FEN string and a one-hot encoded vector indicating that the win probability falls into the third bucket (corresponding to values between 0.5 and 0.75). The second part is the loss mask, which in this example is set to `[1]`.
***
## ClassDef ConvertActionValueDataToSequence
**ConvertActionValueDataToSequence**: Converts chess game data, specifically FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) strings, moves, and win probabilities into a sequence of integers suitable for machine learning models.

attributes:
· num_return_buckets: An integer specifying the number of return buckets used for categorizing win probabilities. This attribute is inherited from the base class ConvertToSequence.

Code Description: The ConvertActionValueDataToSequence class extends the ConvertToSequence base class, focusing on converting chess game data into a structured sequence format. It overrides the abstract property `_sequence_length` to define the length of the output sequence, which includes the state representation (derived from FEN), action (derived from move), and win probability (categorized into return buckets).

The `map` method takes an element in bytes format as input, decodes it using a predefined coder (`CODERS['action_value']`) to extract the FEN string, move, and win probability. Each component is then processed:
- The FEN string is converted into a state representation using `_process_fen`.
- The move is transformed into an action representation using `_process_move`.
- The win probability is categorized into one of the return buckets defined by `_return_buckets_edges` using `_process_win_prob`.

These processed components are concatenated to form the final sequence. The method returns this sequence along with a loss mask, which indicates that only the last element (related to the return bucket) should be considered during training.

Note: This class is particularly useful for preparing data for reinforcement learning models where understanding the relationship between game states, actions taken, and potential outcomes is crucial.

Output Example: Given `num_return_buckets=5`, an instance of ConvertActionValueDataToSequence would have `_return_buckets_edges` calculated accordingly. Suppose the input element decodes to a FEN string representing a specific board state, a move like "e2e4", and a win probability of 0.6. The output sequence might look something like this:

- State representation (from FEN): [1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (a vector of integers representing the board)
- Action representation (from move): [0, 0, 1, ..., 0] (a one-hot encoded vector for the move)
- Return bucket (from win probability): [0, 0, 1, 0, 0] (one-hot encoding indicating the win probability falls into the third bucket)

The final sequence would be a concatenation of these vectors: [1, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0, 1, ..., 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. The loss mask would be an array with all elements set to True except for the last one, which is False, indicating that only the return bucket should influence the loss calculation.
### FunctionDef _sequence_length(self)
**_sequence_length**: This function calculates and returns the total sequence length required for processing action-value data by adding two to a predefined SEQUENCE_LENGTH from the tokenizer module.

parameters:
· None: The function does not accept any parameters.

Code Description: The function _sequence_length is designed to determine the appropriate sequence length needed for converting action-value data into a sequence format. It retrieves a base sequence length value from the tokenizer module, which presumably represents the maximum or standard length of sequences expected in the dataset. To this base length, it adds two additional units. These extra units are likely intended to account for special tokens that might be added at the beginning or end of each sequence, such as start-of-sequence (s) and action (a) markers, or possibly an additional token like a reward (r) marker, as indicated in the comment within the code.

Note: This function is typically used internally by data loading or preprocessing classes to ensure that all sequences are of uniform length, which is crucial for batch processing in machine learning models. Developers should be aware that any changes to the SEQUENCE_LENGTH constant in the tokenizer module will directly affect the output of this function and consequently the sequence lengths used throughout the data pipeline.

Output Example: If the tokenizer.SEQUENCE_LENGTH is set to 10, calling _sequence_length() would return 12, representing a total sequence length of 10 plus two additional tokens.
***
### FunctionDef map(self, element)
**map**: This function processes a byte-encoded chess data element into a sequence suitable for training machine learning models. It decodes the input bytes to extract FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string, move, and win probability, then transforms these components into numerical representations that can be concatenated to form a complete sequence.

**parameters**:
· element: A byte-encoded string containing chess data including FEN notation, a move, and the win probability.

**Code Description**: The function begins by decoding the input `element` using a predefined coder from `constants.CODERS['action_value']`. This decoder extracts three pieces of information: the FEN string (`fen`), the move (`move`), and the win probability (`win_prob`). 

The FEN string is processed by `_process_fen`, which converts it into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models. The `move` string is converted to its corresponding action integer using `_process_move`. The win probability is categorized into predefined buckets using `_process_win_prob` with the provided bucket edges (`self._return_buckets_edges`). 

These processed components—state (from FEN), action, and return bucket—are concatenated into a single sequence. This sequence along with a loss mask (`self._loss_mask`) is returned as output.

**Note**: The function is part of a data processing pipeline that prepares chess game data for training machine learning models. It ensures that all input data components are transformed into numerical formats compatible with these models.

**Output Example**: Given an input byte-encoded string representing a chess position, move, and win probability, the function might return:
- Sequence: `array([26, 34, 27, 35, 28, 36, 29, 37, 30, 38, 31, 39, 32, 40, 33, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 50, 0, 0, 1], dtype=int32)`
- Loss Mask: `array([1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=int32)`

Here, the sequence includes the numerical representation of the chessboard state (first 32 integers), the action taken (integer 50), and a one-hot encoded return bucket indicating the win probability falls into the third bucket (last three integers). The loss mask indicates which parts of the sequence are valid for training.
***
## FunctionDef build_data_loader(config)
**build_data_loader**: Returns a data loader specifically configured for chess datasets based on the provided configuration settings.

**parameters**:
· config: An instance of `config_lib.DataConfig` that contains various parameters needed to configure the data loading process, such as dataset split, policy type, number of records, batch size, shuffling options, and more.

**Code Description**: The function `build_data_loader` initializes a data loader tailored for chess datasets using configurations provided in the `DataConfig` object. It starts by constructing a `BagDataSource` pointing to a specific bag file located in the project's data directory, which is determined by the dataset split and policy specified in the configuration.

The number of records to be loaded is then set based on the `num_records` attribute from the configuration. If this value exceeds the total number of available records in the dataset, a `ValueError` is raised to prevent an attempt to load more data than what is available. If no specific number of records is provided, all records in the dataset are considered.

A sampler is created using `pygrain.IndexSampler`, configured with the determined number of records, no sharding (meaning the data will not be split across multiple shards), and shuffle options as specified by the configuration. The seed for shuffling can also be set through the configuration to ensure reproducibility.

Next, a series of transformations are defined. These include a policy-specific transformation that processes the dataset according to the chess policy being used (e.g., handling different types of moves or strategies) and a batching operation that groups records into batches of a specified size (`batch_size`), discarding any remaining records that do not fit into a complete batch.

Finally, a `pygrain.DataLoader` is instantiated with the data source, sampler, transformations, and additional options such as worker count for parallel processing. This loader can then be used to efficiently load and preprocess chess dataset records during training or evaluation phases of a machine learning model.

**Note**: Ensure that the configuration provided matches the available datasets in terms of splits and policies. Incorrect configurations may lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: The function returns an instance of `pygrain.DataLoader` configured with the specified parameters, ready to be used for loading and processing chess dataset records. For example:
```
<pygrain.DataLoader object at 0x7f8b1c2a3d50>
```
