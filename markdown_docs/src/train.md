## FunctionDef main(argv)
**main**: The main function serves as the entry point of the training script. It processes command-line arguments, configures the policy type, sets up the predictor and evaluation configurations, trains a model using these configurations, and evaluates the trained model.

parameters:
Â· argv: A sequence of strings representing the command-line arguments passed to the program.

Code Description: The function begins by checking if there are any additional command-line arguments beyond the script name itself. If more than one argument is found, it raises an error indicating that too many arguments were provided. It then retrieves a policy type from a configuration library and sets a default number of return buckets to 128.

The function uses pattern matching on the policy type to determine the output size for the predictor model:
- For 'action_value' and 'state_value' policies, the output size is set equal to the number of return buckets.
- For 'behavioral_cloning', the output size is set to the total number of actions defined in a utility module.

Next, it configures the transformer model with various parameters such as vocabulary size, positional encodings, sequence length, and more. It also sets up training and evaluation configurations, specifying learning rates, batch sizes, data shuffling options, and other relevant settings.

The function then proceeds to train the model using the specified configurations and a custom data loader. After training, it constructs a transformer predictor based on the trained parameters and an evaluator for assessing the model's performance. Finally, it prints the evaluation results at the final step of training.

Note: The main function is designed to be run from the command line with no additional arguments beyond the script name itself. It handles specific configurations internally based on predefined policies and constants.

Output Example: Assuming the training completes successfully and the model evaluates well, the output might look something like this:
```
Evaluation results at step 20: {'accuracy': 0.85, 'loss': 0.42}
``` 
This is a mock-up of what could be printed by the evaluator's `step` method, showing accuracy and loss metrics for the model evaluated after 20 training steps.
