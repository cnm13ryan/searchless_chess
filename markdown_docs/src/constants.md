## ClassDef Predictor
**Predictor**: Defines the predictor interface.
attributes:
· initial_params: A callable that returns mutable parameters used by the predictor.
· predict: A callable that performs predictions using the given parameters.

Code Description: The Predictor class outlines an interface for prediction models, specifying two essential components. The first component, `initial_params`, is a callable function designed to generate and return the mutable parameters necessary for the model's operation. These parameters are crucial as they represent the state of the model that can be adjusted during training or inference.

The second component, `predict`, is another callable function responsible for executing predictions based on the provided parameters. This function takes in relevant inputs and uses the model parameters to generate outputs, which could range from classifications, regressions, to more complex predictions depending on the specific implementation of the predictor.

This interface is utilized by other parts of the system, such as the EvaluatorBuilder's `__call__` method, where a Predictor instance is passed along with an evaluation configuration. The evaluator then uses this predictor to assess its performance based on predefined metrics and criteria specified in the configuration.

Note: Usage points highlight that instances of classes implementing the Predictor interface are expected to be compatible with systems like EvaluatorBuilder for seamless integration into larger workflows involving model training, evaluation, and deployment. Developers should ensure their implementations adhere to this interface to maintain compatibility and functionality within such frameworks.
## ClassDef DataLoaderBuilder
**DataLoaderBuilder**: This class serves as a protocol for creating instances of `pygrain.DataLoader` based on a given configuration.

attributes:
· config: An instance of `config_lib.DataConfig` that contains the necessary parameters and settings required to configure the data loader.

Code Description: The `DataLoaderBuilder` is defined as a protocol, which means it specifies a method signature that any conforming class must implement. In this case, the protocol requires the implementation of a callable (`__call__`) method. This method takes a single parameter, `config`, which is expected to be an instance of `config_lib.DataConfig`. The purpose of this method is to construct and return a `pygrain.DataLoader` object that has been configured according to the specifications provided in the `config`.

The use of a protocol here allows for flexibility in how data loaders are created, as any class implementing the `DataLoaderBuilder` protocol can define its own logic for creating a `pygrain.DataLoader`. This design pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where different configurations or types of data sources might require different implementations for loading data.

Note: Usage points include ensuring that any class intended to be used as a data loader builder must implement the `__call__` method with the specified signature. Developers should also ensure that the configuration object passed to this method is correctly formatted and contains all necessary information required by the specific implementation of the data loader being created.
### FunctionDef __call__(self, config)
**__call__**: This function returns a PyGrain data loader configured according to the provided configuration.
parameters:
· config: An instance of `config_lib.DataConfig` that contains the necessary parameters and settings for configuring the data loader.

Code Description: The __call__ method is designed to be invoked like a regular function call on an instance of its class. It takes one parameter, `config`, which should be an object of type `DataConfig` from the module `config_lib`. This configuration object holds all the necessary information and settings required to set up and return a properly configured PyGrain data loader.

The method processes this configuration and uses it to instantiate and configure a `pygrain.DataLoader` object. The returned `DataLoader` is then ready to be used for loading data according to the specifications provided in the `config`.

Note: Usage points include creating an instance of the class that contains the __call__ method, preparing a `DataConfig` object with all necessary configurations, and invoking the instance as if it were a function. This pattern is often seen in builder patterns where the configuration logic is encapsulated within a callable object for ease of use and readability.

## ClassDef Evaluator
**Evaluator**: Defines the interface of an evaluator responsible for assessing a predictor.

attributes:
· params: A mapping representing the parameters of the predictor to be evaluated.
· step: An integer indicating the current evaluation step.

Code Description: The Evaluator class is an abstract base class (ABC) that establishes a standard interface for all evaluators within the system. It includes one abstract method, `step`, which must be implemented by any subclass. This method takes two parameters: `params`, which is a mapping of the predictor's parameters, and `step`, an integer representing the current evaluation step. The purpose of this method is to perform the actual evaluation using the provided parameters and return a mapping containing the results of the evaluation.

Note: Usage points include creating subclasses that implement the `Evaluator` interface by defining their own `step` method. These subclasses can then be instantiated and used in conjunction with predictors and configurations, as demonstrated by the `EvaluatorBuilder.__call__` method, which constructs an evaluator for a given predictor and configuration. This setup is particularly useful in machine learning workflows where models (predictors) need to be periodically evaluated during training or after training completion.
### FunctionDef step(self, params, step)
**step**: This function evaluates a predictor using the specified parameters and step number, returning the results as a mapping of strings to any type.

parameters:
· params: A dictionary-like object containing the parameters used for evaluation. These parameters are typically learned during training and are necessary for making predictions.
· step: An integer representing the current step or iteration in the evaluation process. This could be relevant for logging, debugging, or when the predictor's behavior changes over time.

Code Description: The `step` function is designed to take in a set of parameters (`params`) and an integer (`step`). It uses these inputs to evaluate a predictor, which is likely defined elsewhere in the codebase. The evaluation process could involve feeding data through a model, applying transformations, or performing calculations based on the provided parameters. The results of this evaluation are returned as a mapping (a dictionary-like object) where keys are strings and values can be of any type, allowing for flexibility in what kind of information is returned.

Note: When using the `step` function, developers should ensure that the `params` argument contains all necessary parameters required by the predictor. The `step` parameter is useful for tracking progress or managing state across multiple evaluations, especially in iterative processes such as training loops or simulations.
***
## ClassDef EvaluatorBuilder
**EvaluatorBuilder**: This class acts as a protocol defining how an evaluator should be constructed given a predictor and an evaluation configuration.

attributes:
· predictor: The predictor object to be evaluated. This is typically a model or function that has been trained and whose performance needs to be assessed.
· config: An instance of EvalConfig, which contains the necessary settings and parameters for configuring the evaluation process.

Code Description: EvaluatorBuilder is defined as a protocol, meaning it specifies an interface that other classes must implement. The primary method in this protocol is __call__, which when invoked with a predictor and an evaluation configuration (config), returns an evaluator object. This evaluator can then be used to assess the performance of the given predictor according to the specified configuration.

The process involves the training loop saving the parameters of the predictor at various points, which are subsequently loaded during the evaluation phase. These parameters are passed to the step method of the evaluator, allowing it to perform evaluations based on the current state of the predictor.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where developers need to define custom evaluators for different models or configurations by implementing this protocol. This approach ensures consistency and flexibility in how evaluations are conducted across various parts of an application or project. Developers should ensure that any class they create conforming to EvaluatorBuilder correctly implements the __call__ method, accepting a predictor and configuration, and returning an evaluator object as specified.
### FunctionDef __call__(self, predictor, config)
**__call__**: Returns an evaluator for a given predictor and configuration.

parameters:
· predictor: The predictor to be evaluated, which includes methods for generating initial parameters and making predictions.
· config: The evaluation configuration that specifies how the predictor should be assessed.

Code Description: The __call__ method is designed to construct and return an evaluator object tailored for a specific predictor and its associated configuration. This method accepts two primary arguments: `predictor` and `config`. The `predictor` argument must be an instance of a class implementing the Predictor interface, which includes methods like `initial_params` and `predict`. These methods are crucial as they define how the model's parameters are initialized and how predictions are made, respectively. The `config` argument is an object that encapsulates the evaluation configuration, detailing the criteria and metrics by which the predictor will be evaluated.

The method leverages these inputs to instantiate an evaluator that can assess the performance of the predictor according to the specified configuration. This process typically involves loading the predictor's parameters at various stages (often during training) and using them in conjunction with the `predict` method to generate predictions. These predictions are then compared against ground truth data or other benchmarks as defined by the evaluation configuration, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.

Note: Usage points highlight that this method is particularly useful in machine learning workflows where models need to be periodically evaluated during training or after training completion. Developers can use this method to integrate their custom predictors and evaluation configurations into larger systems, ensuring seamless and consistent evaluation processes. It is essential for developers to ensure that the predictor instances they provide adhere to the Predictor interface to maintain compatibility with the EvaluatorBuilder's __call__ method.

## ClassDef BehavioralCloningData
**BehavioralCloningData**: This class represents a data structure used to encapsulate information relevant to behavioral cloning in chess, specifically storing a FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string and a move.

attributes:
· fen: A string representing the board position using Forsyth-Edwards Notation. FEN is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game.
· move: A string indicating the move made from the given board position, typically in algebraic notation (e.g., "e5", "Nf3").

Code Description: BehavioralCloningData is defined as a subclass of NamedTuple, which means it provides an immutable sequence type with named fields. This class is specifically designed to hold two pieces of information crucial for training models in behavioral cloning scenarios within the domain of chess AI. The 'fen' attribute captures the state of the board at a specific moment, while the 'move' attribute records the action taken by a player from that position. By using NamedTuple, BehavioralCloningData benefits from tuple immutability and readability, making it an efficient way to store and pass around this data without the overhead of a full-fledged class.

Note: Usage points include creating instances of BehavioralCloningData to represent specific board positions and moves for training datasets in chess AI models. This structured format ensures that all necessary information is consistently stored and easily accessible during the model training process.
## ClassDef StateValueData
**StateValueData**: This class represents a named tuple designed to store data related to a state in a game, specifically including the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) string that describes the board position and the probability of winning from that position.

attributes:
· fen: A string representing the board position using the Forsyth-Edwards Notation. FEN is a standard notation for describing a particular board position in chess or shogi.
· win_prob: A floating-point number indicating the probability of winning from the given board position represented by the FEN string.

Code Description: The StateValueData class inherits from Python's NamedTuple, which allows it to be used as an immutable container type. This means that once a StateValueData object is created with specific values for fen and win_prob, those values cannot be changed. Using NamedTuple provides several benefits including memory efficiency, immutability, and the ability to access fields by name or position.

The class includes two attributes:
- fen: This attribute holds the Forsyth-Edwards Notation string which succinctly describes a particular board configuration in chess or shogi. It is crucial for uniquely identifying game states.
- win_prob: This attribute represents the probability of winning from the state described by the FEN string. It is expressed as a floating-point number, typically ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no chance of winning and 1 indicates certainty of winning.

Note: Usage points include scenarios where game states need to be stored alongside their associated win probabilities for analysis or decision-making purposes in applications such as chess engines, game simulations, or machine learning models. The immutability of NamedTuple ensures that the data integrity is maintained throughout its lifecycle, which is particularly important when these objects are used in concurrent or multi-threaded environments.
## ClassDef ActionValueData
**ActionValueData**: This class represents a named tuple designed to encapsulate data related to a specific action within a game state, particularly useful in contexts such as chess where actions correspond to moves. It holds information about the game state (FEN notation), the move being considered, and the estimated probability of winning after making that move.

**attributes**:
· fen: A string representing the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of a chessboard position. FEN is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game.
· move: A string indicating the move to be made from the current position, typically in algebraic notation.
· win_prob: A float value representing the estimated probability of winning after making the specified move from the given board position.

**Code Description**: The ActionValueData class inherits from Python's NamedTuple, which is a factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields. This means that instances of ActionValueData will be immutable and can be accessed using both field names and integer indices. The use of NamedTuple makes the code more readable and self-documenting by providing meaningful names to each element in the tuple.

The class includes three attributes:
- fen: This attribute holds a string that describes the current state of the chessboard using FEN notation, which is crucial for understanding the context of the move.
- move: This attribute contains a string representing the move being evaluated. In chess, moves are often described using algebraic notation (e.g., "e5", "Nf3").
- win_prob: This attribute is a float that represents the probability of winning after executing the specified move from the current board position. It serves as a measure of the quality or potential success of the move.

**Note**: Usage points include scenarios where this class might be utilized, such as in chess engines for storing and retrieving data about possible moves and their associated win probabilities. Developers can create instances of ActionValueData to store and manipulate game state information efficiently, leveraging the immutability and named fields provided by NamedTuple. This makes it easier to maintain and understand code that deals with complex game states and decision-making processes.
