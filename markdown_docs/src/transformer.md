## ClassDef PositionalEncodings
**PositionalEncodings**: This class defines an enumeration of positional encoding types used in transformer models to provide information about the position of tokens in a sequence.

attributes:
· SINUSOID: Represents sinusoidal positional encodings, which are fixed and do not require training.
· LEARNED: Represents learned positional encodings, where the model learns the positional embeddings during training.

Code Description: The PositionalEncodings class is an enumeration that includes two types of positional encoding methods used in transformer architectures. Sinusoidal positional encodings are a type of fixed positional encoding that uses sine and cosine functions to inject information about the position of tokens into the input embeddings. This method does not require any additional training as the values are predetermined based on the sequence length and embedding dimensions. On the other hand, learned positional encodings allow the model to learn the positional information during the training process by treating positions as trainable parameters. This approach can be more flexible but requires a predefined maximum sequence length.

Note: The PositionalEncodings class is utilized in the TransformerConfig class to specify which type of positional encoding should be used for the transformer model. It is also referenced in the embed_sequences function, where it determines whether sinusoidal or learned positional encodings are applied to the input embeddings based on the configuration provided.
## ClassDef TransformerConfig
**TransformerConfig**: Hyperparameters used in the Transformer architectures.

attributes:
· seed: The random seed for parameter initialization, ensuring reproducibility of results.
· vocab_size: The input vocabulary size, representing the number of unique tokens in the input data.
· output_size: The output size, which defaults to the vocabulary size if not specified. This determines the dimensionality of the final layer's output.
· embedding_dim: The dimension of the first embedding layer, which transforms input tokens into dense vectors.
· num_layers: The number of multi-head attention layers in the transformer model, controlling the depth of the network.
· num_heads: The number of heads per multi-head attention layer, affecting parallelism and capacity to capture different aspects of the data.
· use_causal_mask: A boolean indicating whether a causal mask should be used, which is essential for autoregressive models like language models to prevent information leakage from future tokens.
· emb_init_scale: The parameter initialization scale for the embeddings, influencing how weights are initialized at the start of training.
· pos_encodings: Specifies the type of positional encodings to use (sinusoidal or learned), providing information about token positions in a sequence.
· max_sequence_length: The maximum sequence length, relevant when using learned positional encodings. It defines the upper limit for sequences that can be processed.
· widening_factor: Determines how much larger the hidden layer of the feedforward network is compared to the embedding dimension, affecting model capacity and expressiveness.
· apply_qk_layernorm: A boolean indicating whether to apply QK normalization in the attention layers, which can stabilize training.
· apply_post_ln: A boolean indicating whether to apply post-layer normalization after the attention and MLP blocks, enhancing gradient flow and stability.

Code Description: The TransformerConfig class encapsulates all hyperparameters necessary for configuring a transformer model. It initializes default values for several parameters while allowing customization through instance attributes. The `__post_init__` method ensures that if the output size is not explicitly set, it defaults to the vocabulary size. This class is crucial as it provides a structured way to define and manage configuration settings, which are then used throughout various components of the transformer model such as embedding sequences, attention blocks, MLP blocks, and the overall decoder architecture.

Note: Usage points include setting up different configurations for training experiments, fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific tasks, or adapting the model to handle varying input sizes and sequence lengths. Developers can instantiate this class with desired parameters and pass it to functions like `embed_sequences`, `_attention_block`, `_mlp_block`, `transformer_decoder`, and `build_transformer_predictor` to configure the behavior of these components accordingly. Beginners should pay special attention to parameters such as `vocab_size`, `num_layers`, and `embedding_dim`, which significantly impact model performance and resource requirements.
### FunctionDef __post_init__(self)
**__post_init__**: This method is a special initializer invoked after the primary initialization of an instance of the TransformerConfig class, typically used to perform additional setup or validation.

parameters:
· No explicit parameters: The __post_init__ method does not take any direct parameters. It operates on the attributes of the class instance that have already been initialized.

Code Description: Detailed analysis and description.
The __post_init__ method checks if the attribute `output_size` is set to None. If it is, the method assigns the value of another attribute, `vocab_size`, to `output_size`. This ensures that `output_size` always has a defined value, defaulting to `vocab_size` if not explicitly provided during the object's creation.

Note: Usage points.
This method is particularly useful in scenarios where certain configuration parameters are interdependent or when defaults need to be set based on other attributes. In this case, it ensures that `output_size` is always initialized, providing a fallback value from `vocab_size`. This can prevent errors related to undefined variables and streamline the configuration process for users of the TransformerConfig class. Developers should ensure that `vocab_size` is correctly defined before relying on this default behavior for `output_size`.
***
## ClassDef MultiHeadDotProductAttention
**MultiHeadDotProductAttention**: Multi-head dot-product attention mechanism as described by Vaswani et al. (2017). This class implements a multi-head self-attention layer, which is a fundamental component of transformer models.

attributes:
· num_heads: Specifies the number of parallel attention heads to use in the model.
· num_hiddens_per_head: Defines the dimensionality of each head's hidden space.
· name: An optional string that names the module for easier identification and debugging.
· apply_qk_layernorm: A boolean flag indicating whether layer normalization should be applied to the query (q) and key (k) matrices. This can enhance training stability.

Code Description: The MultiHeadDotProductAttention class is a subclass of hk.Module, designed to perform multi-head self-attention on input data. Upon initialization, it sets up parameters for the number of heads, hidden dimensions per head, an optional name, and whether layer normalization should be applied to queries and keys. During the forward pass (defined in the __call__ method), the class processes inputs through linear transformations to generate query (q), key (k), and value (v) matrices. If specified, it applies layer normalization to q and k for improved training stability. The q and k matrices are then reshaped to align with the number of heads and hidden dimensions per head. Attention scores are computed using a dot product between q and k, scaled by the square root of the hidden dimension size, and optionally masked (e.g., for causal masking in language modeling). These scores are normalized using softmax, and the resulting attention weights are used to compute the final output through a weighted sum with the v matrix. The output is reshaped back to its original form before being passed through a final linear transformation.

Note: This class is typically integrated into larger models like transformers, where it plays a crucial role in capturing dependencies between different positions in the input sequence. It can be configured with various parameters to adapt to different tasks and architectures.

Output Example: Given an input tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_size), the MultiHeadDotProductAttention class will return a tensor of the same shape after applying the multi-head attention mechanism. For instance, if the input is a batch of 32 sequences, each containing 10 tokens with an embedding size of 512, and the configuration specifies 8 heads with 64 hidden dimensions per head, the output will also be a tensor of shape (32, 10, 512).
### FunctionDef __init__(self, num_heads, num_hiddens_per_head, name, apply_qk_layernorm)
**__init__**: Initializes an instance of the MultiHeadDotProductAttention module, setting up essential parameters for multi-head attention mechanisms.

parameters:
· num_heads: Specifies the number of parallel attention heads to be used within the model. Each head can capture different aspects of the input data.
· num_hiddens_per_head: Defines the dimensionality of each attention head's hidden layer. This parameter controls the capacity and complexity of information processed by each head.
· name: An optional string that assigns a name to the module, which can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.
· apply_qk_layernorm: A boolean flag indicating whether Layer Normalization should be applied to the query (Q) and key (K) matrices. Applying layer normalization can enhance training stability by normalizing these matrices.

Code Description: The __init__ method is a constructor that initializes the MultiHeadDotProductAttention class with specified parameters. It inherits from a superclass, likely a base module or layer class, using `super().__init__(name=name)` to ensure proper initialization of any inherited attributes and methods. The method then assigns the provided arguments to instance variables (`self._num_heads`, `self._num_hiddens_per_head`, `self._apply_qk_layernorm`). These variables are used throughout the class to define the behavior and functionality of the attention mechanism, such as the number of heads and whether layer normalization is applied.

Note: When creating an instance of MultiHeadDotProductAttention, developers should specify the number of heads and hidden neurons per head according to their model's requirements. The `name` parameter is optional but can be helpful for identifying specific instances in complex models or during debugging. Setting `apply_qk_layernorm` to True can improve training stability by normalizing the query and key matrices, which might be beneficial in deeper or more complex architectures.
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, inputs_q, inputs_kv, mask)
**__call__**: This function computes the output of a multi-head dot product attention mechanism, which is a core component in transformer models. It takes query, key-value inputs, and an optional mask to compute the weighted sum of values based on the attention scores between queries and keys.

parameters:
· inputs_q: A JAX array representing the query sequences with shape [batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_size].
· inputs_kv: A JAX array representing the key-value sequences with shape [batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_size]. This can be the same as inputs_q in some cases.
· mask: An optional JAX array used to mask out certain positions in the attention scores. It has a boolean value where True indicates positions that should not contribute to the output.

Code Description: The function begins by determining the batch size, sequence length, and embedding size from the query input shape. It then calculates the total number of hidden units across all heads (`num_hiddens`) and applies linear transformations (without bias) to both the queries (`q`) and keys/values (`k` and `v`). If layer normalization is enabled (`apply_qk_layernorm`), it normalizes the query and key vectors using the `layer_norm` function. The transformed query, key, and value matrices are reshaped to separate dimensions for batch size, sequence length, number of heads, and hidden units per head.

The attention scores are computed as the dot product between queries and keys, scaled by the square root of the hidden units per head to prevent large values from dominating the softmax function. If a mask is provided, it modifies the attention scores such that masked positions receive very low (negative infinity) scores, effectively excluding them from contributing to the output.

The normalized attention scores are then applied to the value matrix through another dot product operation, and the resulting tensor is reshaped back to its original form before being passed through a final linear transformation to match the embedding size of the input queries. This final transformed array represents the attended values for each query in the batch.

Note: The `__call__` function is typically invoked as part of a larger transformer model, where it processes sequences of embeddings to capture dependencies across different positions within the sequence. It plays a crucial role in enabling models to weigh the importance of various parts of the input data when making predictions or generating outputs.

Output Example: Given an input query `inputs_q` with shape [2, 5, 16] (batch size=2, sequence length=5, embedding size=16) and key-value pairs `inputs_kv` with the same shape, along with a mask of shape [2, 5, 5], the function returns an output array of shape [2, 5, 16]. Each element in this output corresponds to the attended value for each query position across all sequences in the batch.
***
## FunctionDef sinusoid_position_encoding(sequence_length, hidden_size, max_timescale)
**sinusoid_position_encoding**: This function generates sinusoidal positional encodings as described in the original Transformer paper. Positional encodings allow the model to understand the order of words in a sequence, which is crucial for tasks like language modeling where word order matters.

**parameters**:
· sequence_length: The length of the input sequence for which positional encodings are generated.
· hidden_size: The dimensionality of the positional encoding vectors. This should be an even number as the function constructs embeddings by pairing sine and cosine values.
· max_timescale: A constant that determines the maximum frequency used in the sinusoidal functions. It helps to control the scale at which the position encodings vary.

**Code Description**: The function starts by creating a sequence of frequencies (`freqs`) from 0 up to `hidden_size` with a step size of 2, ensuring only half of the hidden dimensions are initially considered due to pairing sine and cosine functions. It then calculates the inverse frequency (`inv_freq`) for each frequency in `freqs`, using the formula `max_timescale ** (-freqs / hidden_size)`. This inverse frequency is used to scale the positional indices appropriately.

Next, a sequence of positions (`pos_seq`) from 0 up to `sequence_length` is created. The function then computes the sinusoid inputs by taking the outer product of `pos_seq` and `inv_freq`, resulting in an array where each row corresponds to a position in the sequence and each column corresponds to a different frequency.

The embeddings are constructed by concatenating sine and cosine values of these sinusoid inputs along the last axis. The final step involves slicing the concatenated embeddings to ensure they match the specified `hidden_size`. This is done to handle cases where `hidden_size` might not be exactly twice the number of frequencies considered, ensuring the output dimensions align with expectations.

**Note**: This function is typically used in conjunction with token embeddings in transformer models. It provides a way to inject information about the position of each word into the model without using any trainable parameters, thus making it a fixed positional encoding scheme.

**Output Example**: For `sequence_length=5` and `hidden_size=6`, the output might look like this (values are illustrative):

```
[
  [0.84147098, 0.54030231, 0.90929743, -0.41614684, 0.14112001, 0.9899925],
  [0.90929743, -0.41614684, 0.14112001, 0.9899925, -0.95892427, -0.28366219],
  [0.14112001, 0.9899925, -0.95892427, -0.28366219, -0.7568025, 0.65364362],
  [-0.7568025, 0.65364362, -0.2794155, 0.96017026, 0.65028784, 0.75968791],
  [-0.95892427, -0.28366219, 0.65028784, 0.75968791, 0.90929743, -0.41614684]
]
```

Each row corresponds to a position in the sequence, and each column represents a different dimension of the positional encoding vector.
## FunctionDef embed_sequences(sequences, config)
**embed_sequences**: This function generates embeddings for sequences of tokens by first converting each token into a dense vector using an embedding layer, then scaling these vectors, and finally adding positional encodings to incorporate information about the position of each token within the sequence.

**parameters**:
· sequences: A JAX array containing the input sequences of tokens. Each element in this array should be an integer representing a token from the vocabulary.
· config: An instance of TransformerConfig that contains all necessary hyperparameters for configuring the embedding process, including the type of positional encodings to use and the dimensions of the embeddings.

**Code Description**: The function begins by initializing an embedding layer using Haiku's `hk.Embed` class. This layer is configured with a vocabulary size, embedding dimension, and a truncated normal initializer scaled according to `emb_init_scale`. The input sequences are then passed through this embedding layer to obtain initial token embeddings.

The resulting embeddings are scaled by the square root of the embedding dimension (`embedding_dim`) as per the Transformer model's design. This scaling step is intended to normalize the embeddings, making them more suitable for subsequent operations in the transformer architecture.

Next, the function determines which type of positional encodings to apply based on the `pos_encodings` attribute in the provided configuration. If sinusoidal positional encodings are specified (`PositionalEncodings.SINUSOID`), it calls the `sinusoid_position_encoding` function to generate these encodings for the given sequence length and embedding size.

If learned positional encodings are specified instead (`PositionalEncodings.LEARNED`), the function asserts that the sequence length does not exceed the maximum sequence length defined in the configuration. It then creates an array of positions from 0 up to the sequence length minus one, and uses another Haiku `hk.Embed` layer to generate positional embeddings for these positions.

Finally, the function adds the generated positional encodings to the scaled token embeddings and returns the combined result. This final step ensures that each token's embedding contains information about both its identity (from the initial embedding) and its position within the sequence (from the positional encoding).

**Note**: The `embed_sequences` function is a crucial component in transformer models as it prepares input sequences for further processing by incorporating both semantic and positional information. It is typically used at the beginning of the model's forward pass, before any attention or feedforward operations.

**Output Example**: For an input sequence `[1, 2, 3]`, with a vocabulary size of 5, an embedding dimension of 4, and sinusoidal positional encodings, the output might look like this (values are illustrative):

```
[
  [0.84147098, 0.54030231, 0.90929743, -0.41614684],
  [0.90929743, -0.41614684, 0.14112001, 0.9899925],
  [0.14112001, 0.9899925, -0.95892427, -0.28366219]
]
```

Each row corresponds to a token in the input sequence, and each column represents a dimension of the combined embedding vector that includes both semantic information from the initial embedding layer and positional information from the sinusoidal encodings.
## FunctionDef layer_norm(x)
**layer_norm**: Helper function for layer normalization.
parameters:
· x: Input array to be normalized.

Code Description: The `layer_norm` function is a utility designed to perform layer normalization on an input array `x`. Layer normalization is a technique used in neural networks to stabilize and accelerate training by normalizing the inputs of each layer. This function leverages Haiku's (hk) `LayerNorm` module, specifying that the normalization should be applied along the last axis (`axis=-1`) and that both scale and offset parameters should be created (`create_scale=True`, `create_offset=True`). The input array `x` is passed through this normalization process, and the normalized output is returned.

Note: This function is utilized in multiple parts of a transformer model to ensure consistent input distributions across layers. Specifically, it is called within the `MultiHeadDotProductAttention` class when `apply_qk_layernorm` is set to True, normalizing query (`q`) and key (`k`) vectors before further processing. Additionally, it appears in the `transformer_decoder` function, where it normalizes inputs before attention and MLP blocks, as well as optionally after all layers if `apply_post_ln` is enabled.

Output Example: Given an input array `x` with shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_size]`, the output of `layer_norm(x)` will have the same shape but with normalized values along the last axis. For instance, if `x` represents embeddings in a transformer model, the output will be these embeddings with mean close to 0 and variance close to 1 across each feature dimension for every sample in the batch.
## FunctionDef shift_right(sequences)
**shift_right**: Right-shifts a one-hot encoded input sequence by padding on the temporal axis.

parameters:
· sequences: A JAX array representing the input sequences to be right-shifted. The expected shape is [B, T], where B is the batch size and T is the length of each sequence.

Code Description: The function `shift_right` takes a JAX array as input, which represents a batch of one-hot encoded sequences. To perform the right shift operation, it first creates an array of zeros with a shape that matches the number of batches but has only one temporal step (i.e., [B, 1]). This zero-filled array acts as the beginning-of-sequence (bos) token for each sequence in the batch.

Next, the function concatenates this bos_array to the left side of the original sequences along the temporal axis (axis=1). This operation effectively shifts all elements of the input sequences one position to the right. The last element of each shifted sequence is then discarded by slicing the array up to but not including the last column (padded_sequences[:, :-1]). This step ensures that the output shape remains [B, T], matching the original input shape.

Note: This function is typically used in transformer models where the target sequences need to be right-shifted for training purposes. The shifted sequence serves as the input to the model, while the original sequence acts as the target during loss computation.

Output Example: If the input `sequences` array is:
```
[[1, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]
```
The output of `shift_right(sequences)` will be:
```
[[0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0]]
```
## FunctionDef _mlp_block(inputs, config)
**_mlp_block**: Gated MLP block for the Transformer.
parameters:
· inputs: A jax.Array representing the input data to be processed by the MLP block.
· config: An instance of TransformerConfig containing hyperparameters used in the Transformer architecture.

Code Description: The _mlp_block function implements a gated feedforward neural network (MLP) layer, which is a key component in the Transformer model. This specific implementation uses a gating mechanism combined with the SwiGLU activation function to enhance the expressiveness and efficiency of the MLP block.

The process begins by calculating the dimensionality of the hidden layer (`ffn_dim`), which is determined by multiplying the embedding dimension (`config.embedding_dim`) with a widening factor (`config.widening_factor`). This allows the model to have a larger hidden layer, increasing its capacity to learn complex patterns in the data.

Two linear transformations are applied to the input data using `hk.Linear`, resulting in two separate outputs: `split_1` and `split_2`. Both transformations do not include bias terms (`with_bias=False`). The first output (`split_1`) is passed through a SwiGLU activation function, which is implemented here as `jnn.silu` (Sigmoid Linear Unit), to introduce non-linearity. The second output (`split_2`) remains unactivated.

The gating mechanism then combines the activated and unactivated outputs by element-wise multiplication: `gate_output = jnn.silu(split_1) * split_2`. This operation allows the model to dynamically control the flow of information, enabling it to focus on relevant features while suppressing irrelevant ones.

Finally, a third linear transformation is applied to the gated output to project it back to the original embedding dimension (`config.embedding_dim`). The result is returned as the output of the MLP block. This final layer also does not include bias terms.

Note: Usage points include integrating this function within larger Transformer models such as in the `transformer_decoder` function, where it processes intermediate representations after attention blocks. Developers and beginners should understand that the widening factor significantly impacts the model's capacity to learn complex patterns, while the gating mechanism enhances its ability to selectively process information.

Output Example: Assuming an input tensor of shape [batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim] and a TransformerConfig with `embedding_dim=64` and `widening_factor=4`, the output will have the same shape as the input, i.e., [batch_size, sequence_length, 64]. Each element in this tensor represents the transformed feature vector after passing through the gated MLP block.
## FunctionDef _attention_block(inputs, config)
**_attention_block**: Attention block for the Transformer.
parameters:
· inputs: A JAX array representing the input data to the attention mechanism, typically of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim).
· config: An instance of TransformerConfig containing hyperparameters that configure the behavior of the attention block.

Code Description: The _attention_block function is a crucial component within a transformer model, specifically designed to handle the multi-head self-attention mechanism. This function takes in input data and configuration settings to process the data through an attention layer. It begins by extracting the batch size and sequence length from the shape of the inputs. Depending on whether causal masking is enabled (as specified in the config), it either creates a lower triangular mask or sets the mask to None. This causal mask is essential for autoregressive models, such as language models, where future tokens should not influence the current token's prediction.

The function then initializes an instance of MultiHeadDotProductAttention using parameters from the TransformerConfig object, including the number of heads, hidden dimensions per head, and whether QK normalization should be applied. This attention mechanism processes the input data by generating query (q), key (k), and value (v) matrices through linear transformations. If QK normalization is enabled, it applies layer normalization to stabilize training.

The function calls the MultiHeadDotProductAttention instance with the inputs for both queries and keys/values, along with the causal mask if applicable. The result of this call is returned as the output of the _attention_block function, representing the attended data that captures dependencies between different positions in the input sequence.

Note: This function is typically used within larger transformer architectures, such as the decoder part of a transformer model. It plays a vital role in capturing and utilizing information from various parts of the input sequence to generate contextually relevant outputs.

Output Example: Given an input tensor of shape (32, 10, 512) representing a batch of 32 sequences, each containing 10 tokens with an embedding size of 512, and assuming the configuration specifies 8 heads with 64 hidden dimensions per head and causal masking is enabled, the output will also be a tensor of shape (32, 10, 512). This output tensor represents the attended data after processing through the multi-head attention mechanism.

## FunctionDef build_transformer_predictor(config)
**build_transformer_predictor**: Returns a transformer predictor configured based on the provided `TransformerConfig`.

parameters:
· config: An instance of `TransformerConfig` containing hyperparameters used to configure the transformer model.

Code Description: The function `build_transformer_predictor` initializes and returns a transformer-based prediction model. It uses Haiku (`hk`) to transform the `transformer_decoder` function, which is partially applied with the given configuration. The transformation process prepares the decoder for use in a functional programming style, separating its initialization from application. The function returns an instance of `constants.Predictor`, encapsulating both the initial parameters and the prediction method derived from the transformed decoder.

Note: Usage points include setting up a transformer model for tasks such as language modeling or sequence generation by providing a suitable configuration through `TransformerConfig`. Developers can customize various aspects of the model, including vocabulary size, embedding dimensions, number of layers, and more, to tailor it to specific needs. Beginners should ensure they understand the impact of different configuration parameters on model performance.

Output Example: The function returns an object with two main components:
- `initial_params`: A dictionary containing the initial weights and biases for all layers in the transformer decoder.
- `predict`: A method that applies the transformer decoder to input data using the initialized parameters, returning log softmax probabilities over the vocabulary for each position in the sequence.

This setup allows for easy integration into larger systems where predictions from a transformer model are required.
