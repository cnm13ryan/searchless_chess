## ClassDef DataConfig
**DataConfig**: Config for the data generation.
attributes:
· batch_size: The number of sequences processed together in one batch during training or evaluation.
· shuffle: A boolean indicating whether to shuffle the dataset at the beginning of each epoch, enhancing generalization by varying input order.
· seed: An integer used as a seed for random operations such as shuffling and data transformations. If set to None, no specific seed is used.
· drop_remainder: A boolean that determines if partial batches (batches with fewer samples than batch_size) should be discarded at the end of an epoch.
· worker_count: The number of subprocesses used to parallelize data loading and preprocessing. Setting it to None or 0 means using a default value, typically determined by system capabilities.
· num_return_buckets: Specifies the number of return buckets, which can be relevant for organizing or categorizing returns in reinforcement learning contexts.
· split: A string literal indicating the dataset split being used ('train' for training data and 'test' for testing data).
· policy: An object defining the strategy or method used to create or manipulate the dataset. This could involve specific algorithms or rules.
· num_records: The total number of records (data points) to read from the dataset, useful when dealing with large datasets that do not fit into memory all at once.

Code Description: DataConfig is a configuration class designed to encapsulate various parameters related to data handling and preprocessing in machine learning workflows. It includes settings for batch processing, shuffling, parallelization, and more, which are crucial for optimizing the performance and efficiency of training and evaluation processes. The attributes allow customization based on specific requirements of different datasets and tasks.

Note: This class is utilized by other configuration classes such as TrainConfig and EvalConfig to specify data-related configurations for training and evaluation phases respectively.

Output Example: An instance of DataConfig might look like this:
DataConfig(batch_size=32, shuffle=True, seed=42, drop_remainder=False, worker_count=4, num_return_buckets=10, split='train', policy=some_policy_object, num_records=None)
## ClassDef TrainConfig
**TrainConfig**: Config for the training function.
attributes:
· data: An instance of DataConfig specifying various parameters related to data handling and preprocessing during training.
· learning_rate: A float representing the learning rate used by the Adam optimizer, which controls the step size during optimization.
· max_grad_norm: A float indicating the maximum gradient norm value. This is used for gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients (default is 1.0).
· num_steps: An integer denoting the total number of gradient steps or iterations that will be performed during training.
· ckpt_frequency: An optional integer specifying how often checkpoints should be saved in terms of gradient steps. If set to None, checkpointing is disabled.
· ckpt_max_to_keep: An optional integer defining the maximum number of checkpoints to retain. If set to None, all checkpoints are kept (default is 1).
· save_frequency: An optional integer indicating the frequency at which checkpoints should be saved permanently in gradient steps. If set to None, all checkpoints are temporary.
· log_frequency: An optional integer specifying how often logging should occur during training in terms of gradient steps. If set to None, no logging will take place.

Code Description: TrainConfig is a configuration class designed to encapsulate various parameters essential for setting up and controlling the training process in machine learning workflows. It includes settings related to data handling through an instance of DataConfig, optimization via the learning rate, gradient management with max_grad_norm, and checkpointing and logging frequencies to monitor and save the model's state during training. These attributes allow customization based on specific requirements of different models and datasets.

Note: This class is utilized in conjunction with other configuration classes such as EvalConfig to specify configurations for both training and evaluation phases respectively. Properly configuring TrainConfig ensures efficient and effective training by optimizing data handling, learning dynamics, and model state management. An instance of TrainConfig might look like this:
TrainConfig(data=DataConfig(batch_size=32, shuffle=True, seed=42, drop_remainder=False, worker_count=4, num_return_buckets=10, split='train', policy=some_policy_object, num_records=None), learning_rate=0.001, max_grad_norm=1.5, num_steps=10000, ckpt_frequency=1000, ckpt_max_to_keep=3, save_frequency=2000, log_frequency=100)
## ClassDef EvalConfig
**EvalConfig**: Config for the evaluator.
attributes:
· data: An instance of DataConfig specifying the configuration details for the evaluation dataset, including batch size, shuffling options, seed values, worker count, number of return buckets, split type, policy, and number of records.
· num_eval_data: An optional integer indicating the specific number of data points to consider during the evaluation process. If set to None, all available data points will be used.
· use_ema_params: A boolean flag that determines whether to use exponentially moving average (EMA) parameters for the model during evaluation. This can help stabilize and improve the performance of the model by using smoothed parameter values.
· policy: An object defining the strategy or method used to play moves with the model during evaluation. This could involve specific algorithms or rules tailored to the task at hand.
· num_return_buckets: An integer specifying the number of return buckets, which can be relevant for organizing or categorizing returns in reinforcement learning contexts.
· batch_size: An optional integer representing the batch size for the evaluation process. If set to None, a default value will be used.

Code Description: EvalConfig is a configuration class designed to encapsulate various parameters related to model evaluation in machine learning workflows. It includes settings for data handling, the number of data points to evaluate, parameter usage, policy definition, return bucket organization, and batch processing. These attributes allow customization based on specific requirements of different models and tasks, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in the evaluation phase.

Note: This class is utilized alongside other configuration classes such as TrainConfig to specify configurations for both training and evaluation phases respectively. Properly configuring EvalConfig can significantly impact the accuracy and efficiency of model evaluations.

Output Example: An instance of EvalConfig might look like this:
EvalConfig(data=DataConfig(batch_size=32, shuffle=True, seed=42, drop_remainder=False, worker_count=4, num_return_buckets=10, split='test', policy=some_policy_object, num_records=None), num_eval_data=1000, use_ema_params=True, policy=some_evaluation_policy, num_return_buckets=5, batch_size=64)
